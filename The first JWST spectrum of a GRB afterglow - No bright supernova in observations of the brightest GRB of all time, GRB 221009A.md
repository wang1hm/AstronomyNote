# ABSTRACT
JWST and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observations of the afterglow of GRB 221009A(the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever observed)
NIRSPEC (0.6-5.5 micron) and MIRI (5-12 micron) 12 days (first mid-IR spectroscopy performed for a GRB)
single power-law, β ≈ 0.35 and $A_V$ = 4.9, in excess of the notional Galactic value
patchy extinction within the Milky Way or dust in the GRB host galaxy
X-ray and optical/IR regimes are not on the same branch of the synchrotron spectrum of the afterglow
The shape of the JWST spectrum is near-identical in the optical/nIR to X-shooter spectroscopy obtained at 0.5 days and to later time observations with HST. 
==The lack of spectral evolution== suggests the SNe is either substantially fainter or bluer than SN 1998bw. 
a disc-like host galaxy, edge-on
The host galaxy appears rather typical amongst long-GRB hosts and suggests that the extreme properties of GRB 221009A ==are not directly tied to its galaxy-scale environment.==

# Introduction
GRB 221009A是迄今为止最亮的GRB, 估算的事件率是几十年一次，有很多的后续的gamma ray到radio的观测，红移z=0.151 - 是一个local源
一般情况下，low redshift - low energy events, perhaps of a fundamentally different emission process
但GRB 221009A the isotropic-equivalent energy of GRB 221009A is $E_{γ,iso}$ > $10^{54}$ erg, comparable to the most energetic distant GRBs seen at high redshift.
offering the opportunity to test similarities between the substantially sub-luminous local GRB population, and the much more luminous cosmological population.
难点：位于Galactic plane，消光大且不确定，where foreground extinction is both large AV ∼ 4.2 and uncertain, where crowding complicates optical and IR observations, and where even X-ray observations must contend with additional contributions from the dust scattered X-ray halo

# Observations
z = 0.151
## JWST
### spectra:
NIRSPEC: prism - 0.5-5.5 microns at a low (and variable) spectral resolution
MIRI observations: low resolution mode, and span the range from 5-12 microns
### image:
MIRI: 11 seconds, F560W(AB) = 17.9 ± 0.1
NE-SW host galaxy

## Supporting observations
Swift XRT data, as well as obtaining observations at the GTC in the optical, TNG in near-infrared and with NOEMA in the millimeter regime.

## HST
8 November 2022, 19 November 2022 and 4 December 2022
The images clearly show the afterglow in all bands super-imposed on an underlying host galaxy.
