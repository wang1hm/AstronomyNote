## Abstract
unexpected population of red galaxies: z ∼ 7 − 9 and high masses of $M∗ ≳ 10^{}$M⊙
fit Sersic profiles to the F200W NIRCam images of the 13 massive galaxy candidates - Satisfactory fits were obtained for nine galaxies
 => effective radii are extremely small, ranging from $r_e$ ∼ 80 pc to $r_e$ ∼ 300 pc， with a mean of ⟨$r_e$⟩ ≈ 150 pc
We find that, despite the high redshift galaxies having 10 − 20 times smaller half-light radii, the central stellar densities are comparable to those of their putative descendants at later times.
