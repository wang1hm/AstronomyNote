## CHANGING-LOOK QUASAR CANDIDATES: FIRST RESULTS FROM FOLLOW-UP SPECTROSCOPY OF HIGHLY OPTICALLY VARIABLE QUASARS
### Abstract
Active galactic nuclei (AGN) that show strong rest-frame optical/UV variability in their blue continuum and broad line emission are classified as changing-look AGN, or at higher luminosities, changing-look quasars (CLQs). These surprisingly large and sometimes rapid transitions challenge accepted models of quasar physics and duty cycles, offer several new avenues for study of quasar host galaxies, and open a wider interpretation of the cause of differences between broad and narrow line AGN. To better characterize extreme quasar variability, we present follow-up spectroscopy as part of a comprehensive search for CLQs across the full SDSS footprint using spectroscopically confirmed quasars from the SDSS DR7 catalog. Our primary selection requires large-amplitude (|∆g| > 1 mag, |∆r| > 0.5 mag) variability over any of the available time baselines probed by the SDSS and Pan-STARRS 1 surveys. We employ photometry from the Catalina Sky Survey to verify variability behavior in CLQ candidates where available, and confirm CLQs using optical spectroscopy from the William Herschel, MMT, Magellan, and Palomar telescopes. For our adopted S/N threshold on variability of broad Hβ emission, we find 17 new CLQs, yielding a confirmation rate of $\gtrsim$ 20%. These candidates are at lower Eddington ratio relative to the overall quasar population which supports a disk-wind model for the broad line region. Based on our sample, the CLQ fraction increases from 10% to roughly half as the continuum flux ratio between repeat spectra at 3420 A increases from 1.5 to 6. We release a catalog of over 200 highly variable candidates to facilitate future CLQ searches.

### Point
#### Optical:
SDSS/Pan-STARRS 1 3$\pi$ /Catalina Sky Survey
#### Radio
exclude potential jet-related -> match to the unified radio catalog
#### CLQ Candidate Selection
In particular, CLQ candidates are selected by requiring: 
(i) a magnitude change of ∆g > 1 mag and ∆r > 0.5 mag among SDSS and PS1 measurements with errors < 0.15 mag
(ii) no radio detection to exclude jet-related variability
(iii) a redshift z < 0.83
(iv) no BOSS spectrum
(v) a current g magnitude at least 1 mag dimmer or brighter compared to the SDSS spectral epoch

#### Spectroscopy and analysis
SDSS/BOSS+WHT+MMT+Magellan+Palomar
#### Defination of CLQs
$N_\sigma(\lambda)=\left(f_2-f_1\right) / \sqrt{\sigma_2^2+\sigma_1^2}$
define CLQs as having a visual disappearance (or emergence) of broad Hβ at a Nσ(Hβ) > 3 level
#### Interesting point
HeII respond quickly and strongly to continuum variations -> the size of the He II emission region is very close to the ionizing continuum source
#### Discussion
The two fundamental questions we can address are: 
a) what is the CLQ rate among highly variable AGN
b) is the loss or emergence of BEL flux in CLQs due to a rare and different physical mechanism than that causing variability in the overall population of quasars?

find that strongly varying quasars often show a large contrast in Balmer BELs between dim and bright states - defination of CLQs
##### Physical origin of CLQ Varability
found that variable extinction by dust cannot account for BEL flux changes relative to the continuum in CLQs, nor the observed timescales
 z<1 + lack foreground spectral features -> unlikely to be the result of lensing
 
specifically confirm a trend with Eddington-ratio from our follow-up spectroscopy, and it is consistent with the well known anti-correlation between Eddington ratio and variability amplitude
    We find that CLQs have lower Eddington-ratios than a control sample matched in redshift and luminosity
    the CLQs are found near the critical luminosity below which the BLR disappears
Assuming the variability is indeed due to an accretion rate change, and that the estimated dim state values for CLQs as well as the adopted values for η and α are not too inaccurate, our results indicate that the Elitzur & Ho (2009) model for the disk-wind BLR may provide a good description of CLQs

A key question is how to connect the observed timescales for CLQ transitions with theoretical timescales for accretion disks
The expected timescale for a major accretion rate change is the viscous timescale
    However, the expected viscous timescale in the optical-emitting region of the disk is orders of magnitude longer than what is observed for CLQ transitions
Either the instability (or instabilities) must propagate throughout the disk far faster than the viscous timescale, such as over a thermal timescale, or our calculation of a viscous timescale is off by orders of magnitude.
##### Future work
Our sample is dominated by dimming events (or “turn-off” CLQs) because of the sample construction: since our parent sample is the DR7 quasar catalog, most have broad BELs in the early state. Only two of the CLQs presented here are transitioning to a bright state

## Discovery of 21 New Changing-look AGNs in the Northern Sky
### Abstract 
The rare case of changing-look (CL) active galactic nuclei (AGNs), with the appearance or disappearance of broad Balmer emission lines within a few years, challenges our understanding of the AGN unified model. We present a sample of 21 new CL AGNs at 0.08 < z < 0.58, which doubles the number of such objects known to date. These new CL AGNs were discovered in various ways, from (1) repeat spectra in the SDSS, (2) repeat spectra in the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST) and SDSS, and (3) photometric variability and new spectroscopic observations. We use the photometric data from surveys, including the SDSS imaging survey, the Pan-STARRS1, the DESI Legacy imaging survey, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey, and the Palomar Transient Factory. The estimated upper limits of the transition timescale of the CL AGNs in this sample spans from 0.9 to 13 years in the rest-frame. The continuum flux in the optical and mid-infrared becomes brighter when the CL AGNs turn on, or vice versa. Variations of more than 0.2 mag in the W1 band were detected in 15 CL AGNs during the transition. The optical and mid-infrared variability is not consistent with the scenario of variable obscuration in 10 CL AGNs at more than the 3σ confidence level. We confirm a bluer-when-brighter trend in the optical. However, the mid-infrared WISE colors W1–W2 become redder when the objects become brighter in the W1 band, possibly due to a stronger hot dust contribution in the W2 band when the AGN activity becomes stronger. The physical mechanism of type transition is important for understanding the evolution of AGNs.

## A NEW CLASS OF CHANGING-LOOK LINERS
### Abstract
We report the discovery of six active galactic nuclei (AGN) caught “turning on" during the first nine months of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey. The host galaxies were classified as LINERs by weak narrow forbidden line emission in their archival SDSS spectra, and detected by ZTF as nuclear transients. In five of the cases, we found via follow-up spectroscopy that **they had transformed into broad-line AGN, reminiscent of the changing-look LINER** iPTF16bco. In one case, ZTF18aajupnt/AT2018dyk, follow-up HST UV and ground- based optical spectra revealed **the transformation into a narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) with strong [Fe VII, X, XIV] and He II λ4686 coronal lines.** Swift monitoring observations of this source reveal bright UV emission that tracks the optical flare, accompanied by a luminous soft X-ray flare that peaks ∼60 days later. Spitzer follow-up observations also detect a luminous mid-infrared flare implying a large covering fraction of dust. Archival light curves of the entire sample from CRTS, ATLAS, and ASAS-SN constrain the onset of the optical nuclear flaring from a prolonged quiescent state. Here we present the systematic selection and follow-up of this new class of changing-look LINERs, compare their properties to previously reported changing-look Seyfert galaxies, and conclude that they are a unique class of transients well-suited to test the uncertain physical processes associated with the LINER accretion state.
### Point
The nature of this spectral transformation is most often attributed to changes in accretion rate

the status of LINERs as low-luminosity AGN remnants is a topic of debate, as weak emission in some LINERs could also be powered by shocks, winds, outflows, or photoionization from post-AGB stellar populations

report the discovery of six new CLAGN, all classified as LINER galaxies by their archival SDSS spectra, detected as nuclear transients by the Zwicky Transient Facility

However, here we also report the surprising appearance of coronal lines coincident with an increase in UV/optical and soft X-ray continuum emission and broad Balmer emission consistent with a NLS1 in this galaxy previously classified as a LINER.

#### Capturing the Transition in Archival Light Curves
(A) ZTF18aajupnt/AT2018dyk — ZTF-matched aperture photometry in g band shows that ZTF18aajupnt/AT2018dyk began flaring some time before 2018 March (58200 MJD) ∼2 months prior to discovery in difference imaging on 2018 May 31, and 3 months prior to confirmation of a spectroscopic change. The most recent difference imaging photometry shows a slow decline at constant color. **Transition timescale: < 0.3 years, the fastest in the sample.**
(B) ZTF18aasuray — Discovery with ZTF difference imaging occurred on 2018 May 10 and shows a slow symmetric rise and decline lasting 300 days. ZTF18aasuray displayed flaring in ASAS-SN data beginning around 2011 Aug (55800 MJD), 6.8 years prior to spectroscopic confirmation of the changing look which occurred on 2018 June 21. Prior to this flaring, Catalina Real-time Transient Survey observations in V-band showed no variability above the 0.1 mag level. **Transition timescale: < 6.8 years.**
(C) ZTF18aahiqfi — The rise (seen in ZTF g-band matched photometry) starts approximately at 2017 Sept (58000 MJD), 7 months prior to its spectroscopic change. It peaks around 2018 May (58250 MJD; ∼1 month after discovery with ZTF difference imaging on 2018 April 8) and subsequently shows a sharp decline. Prior to this flaring, Catalina Real-time Transient Survey observations in V-band and ASAS-SN showed no variability above the 0.1 mag level. **Transition timescale: < 0.6 years.**
(D) ZTF18aaidlyq — This source displayed a slight flare in ASAS-SN data just after 2017 Sept (58000 MJD), 7 months prior to detection in ZTF difference imaging and 8 months prior to spectroscopic confirmation of the existence of a BLR, but was faint and quiescent in CRTS beginning in 2005 May **(note that this source is near a bright star)**. **Transition timescale: < 0.7 years.**
(E) ZTF18aaabltn — CRTS, ATLAS and ASAS-SN show a continuous rise starting around 2016 April (57500 MJD) but this disregards some slight flaring (by 0.2 mag) events at 2008 Nov and just before 2014 Dec (57000 MJD), with both returning to very flat pre-activity levels. This constrains the spectroscopic change to happening within 1000 days (< 2.7 years) of the flare start time, the first large flare occurring within 9 months of being observed to be a LINER in 2007 Feb. **Transition timescale: < 2.6 years.**
(F) ZTF18aasszwr — The rise is visible in CRTS around 2018 July (56500 MJD), after which it may have plateaued for a time. Most recently there has been a sharp rise and decline around 2018 May (58250 MJD), with the peak reaching > 1 mag above original levels. The transition from quiescence thus happened roughly in real time, and was observed with difference imaging 4 months after the flaring began, with the spectroscopic change confirmed within 5.3 years of the initial rise time, and within 5 months of the onset of the most recent flare. We note that two decades ago, ZTF18aasszwr was a variable (rms = 0.14 mJy) radio source between the NRAO VLA Sky Survey and Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty centimeters (NVSS and FIRST; Ofek & Frail 2011), with a peak flux density at 1.4 GHz of Fν = 2.17 mJy. **Transition timescale: < 5.3 years.**
