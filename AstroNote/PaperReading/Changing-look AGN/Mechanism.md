## Q1: What is CL AGN?
A1: Drastic change in spectra
## Q2: What is the mechanism?
Obscuration => x-ray change
Intrinsic(change in the emission from the accretion disc or its associated Comptonisation region)
Intrinsic => 1. complex multi-band recovery. inconsistent with obscuration
                  2. strong change in IR
                  3. low polarization => not scattering
                  4. *different variability of emission lines* - balmer decrement (Ha/Hb) changed /  IR / timescale / reddening inconsistent / upper limit on column density
                  5. QPE(quasi periodic) cannot be due obscuration because of the characteristic spectral evolution during outburst
Intrinsic: 1. radiation pressure instability - happened at innermost part of AGN -> no proper time scale ($10^2$ yr for $10^7\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ )

## Model 1 - repeating semi-regular outburst at a few percent of the Eddington ratio
warm corona -> soft x-ray
$\dot{M}_{E d d}=\frac{48 \pi G M_{B H} m_p}{\sigma_T c}$ 
inner: ADAF flow
outer: standard accretion disk
$R_{A D A F}=2 \alpha_{0.1}^4 \dot{m}^{-2} R_{S c h w}$
standard accretion disk is unstable in the innermost part
transition from the outer stable to the inner unstable radius takes place at: $R_{t r}=1522\left(\alpha_{0.1} m_7\right)^{2 / 21} \dot{m}^{16 / 21} R_{S c h w}$
The two lines cross at the specific accretion rate: $\dot{m}_{s t}=0.0905 \alpha_{0.1}^{41 / 29} m_7^{-1 / 29}$  <= the dependence on the black hole mass in negligible, the dependence on the viscosity coefficient is stronger than linear
$R_{s t}=244 \alpha_{0.1}^{43 / 29} m_7^{2 / 29} R_{S c h w}$

when $\dot{m} < \dot{m}_{st}$,  whole flow is stable
when $\dot{m} > \dot{m}_{st}$, where radiation pressure dominate is unstable => could lead to a limit cycle behavior

viscous timescale:
$\tau_{v i s c, S S}=\frac{1}{\alpha}\left(\frac{R}{H}\right)^2\left(\frac{R^3}{G M_{B H}}\right)^{1 / 2}$

consider the unstable zone, if $\dot{m}$ is just above the threshold $\dot{m}_{st}$, then the radial extension of the unstable zone, δR is much smaller than the radius R itself.
$\tau_{v i s c}=\tau_{v i s c, S S} \frac{\Delta R}{R}$

=> One-zone time dependent toy model
when the accretion rate is not many orders of magnitude below the Eddington ratio
**ADAF efficient**
inner part of the flow generates more energy than the outer part
$L_{ADAF} = \eta \dot{M} c^2$
=> time-dependent accretion rate: $\dot{m}, \alpha, \Delta R/R$ change the cadence, amplitude
==periodic prediction==

$\dot{m}$ = 0.0122, α = 0.02, ∆R = 0.003R

Comparison with observation:
1. expectation: observed light curve
       periodic is hard to observe
       => roughly cover the characteristic timescales
(2. ) unstable zone location <-> location of the obscurer
