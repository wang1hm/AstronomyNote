# Abstract
==Galaxy morphology== is a key parameter in galaxy evolution studies. The enormous number of galaxies which future and current surveys will observe demand of ==automated methods for morphological classification.== Supervised learning techniques have been successfully used for the morphological classification of galaxies from different datasets, including Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), Mapping Galaxies with Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) or Dark Energy Survey (DES). With these proceedings, we release the morphological catalogue for a sample of 670,000 SDSS galaxies based on the ==deep learning models trained on SDSS RGB images with morphological labels from human-based classification catalogues.== The released catalogue includes binary classifications ==(early-type versus late-type, elliptical versus lenticular, identification of edge-on and barred galaxies)== plus a ==T-Type==. The classifications also include k-fold based uncertainties. This is, as of today, the largest catalogue including a T-Type classification. As an example of the scientific potential of this classification, we show ==how the location of the galaxies in the star formation - stellar mass plane (SFR-M∗) depends on morphology.== This is the first time the SFR-M∗ relation is combined with T-Type information for such a large sample of galaxies.
