## Abstract
JWST-NIRSpec spectrum (from the JADES survey) of GN-z11
1.[NeIV]λ2423 transition and semi-forbidden nebular lines tracing gas densities higher than $10^{10} cm^{−3}$ (typical of the Broad Line Region of AGN)
-> indicate GN-z11 also hosts an accreting black hole
2.deep and blueshifted CIVλ1549 absorption => tracing an outflow with a velocity of ∼ 800−1000 $km\cdot s^{−1}$
-> likely driven by the AGN
3.a black hole mass of $log (M_{BH}/M_{\odot})=6.2\pm 0.3$ , accreting at about 5 times the Eddington rate.
=> black hole could have potentially originated even from a stellar mass seed at z∼12-15

## Introduction
Multiple theories -> the formation of black hole seeds in the early Universe and the emergence of very massive black holes (MBH > 10^9 M) observed to be already in place at z=6–7.5
  one of the models most frequently invoked -- Direct Collapse Black Holes, DCBH: Black holes resulting from the direct collapse of primordial clouds (possibly preceded by the formation of a supermassive star) into seeds with masses in the range ∼ 10^4 − 10^6 M
  other models considers: rapid merging of stars and black holes in dense, nuclear star clusters, as well as accretion onto Population III black hole seeds or even normal stellar remnants
求证是哪一种model需要: the observation of black holes at higher redshift (z>10) and at lower masses (MBH < 107 M)

## Observation
Source selection: the brightest galaxy at z>10 in all HST fields (太亮了，发光机制不太可能是纯粹的恒星形成，会挑战galaxy formation model)

JWST NIRSpec: unresolved nuclear component and a disk-like component with an extent of a few 100 pc

[NeIV] : requires photons E > 63.5 eV, this line is an unambiguous AGN tracer - commonly seen in AGN and not seen in star forming galaxies, not even those hosting the most extreme Wolf-Rayet stars
CII∗λ1335 fluorescent line: commonly observed in AGN
[NIV]λ1483, NIV]λ1486 doublet: very sensitive to the gas density (while being relatively insensitive to ionization parameter, metallicity and shape of the ionizing spectrum) => densities much higher than $10^5 cm^{−3}$
the upper limit on the doublet ratio, F([NIV]1483)/F(NIV]1486)<0.15, requires densities  $> 10^6 cm^−3$ 
four semi-forbidden lines -> n>$10^9 cm^>{-3}$
如此高密度不太可能是普通的HII region，只能是AGN

宽线的情况：show the typical ‘broad lines’ seen in type 1 quasars
宽线的宽度与黑洞质量成平方，考虑narrow line seyfert 1，whose permitted lines are broader than their forbidden lines -> have small black holes
This seems to be the case of GN-z11, in which semi-forbidden (NIII], NIV]) and permitted lines (MgII) all have widths between 430 km s−1 and 470 km s−1, while [NeIII] has a significantly narrower width (340±30 km s−1)
如果BLR is visible, the un-obscured accretion disc should be visible at UV-optical wavelength -> its slope is consistent with that expected for accretion discs

CIV吸收线
虽然可能是恒星，但会要求金属丰度很高，这与nebular lines展示的金属丰度冲突，所以不太可能是stellar-wind origin
galactic outflow velocities are only of a few 100$km\cdot s^-1$
但观测到是800-1000 km/s
所以更可能是BAL(broad absorption line) quasar

看到host galaxy: a star formation history with a burst between 10 and 50 Myr before the time of observation, followed by a steep decline in star formation rate 可能正是CIV暗示的outflow导致的quenching

测到黑洞质量$10^6 M_{\odot}$, 根据super Eddington accretion/ Eddington accretion/ sub-Eddington accretion. z=6-7的可以由这个形成
