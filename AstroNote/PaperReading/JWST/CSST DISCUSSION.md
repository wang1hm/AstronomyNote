### ABSTRACT 
Supermassive black holes, and the outflows they drive, are an established part of our understanding of galaxy evolution. **Indeed, cosmological models rely on outflows to ==reproduce the observed scaling relations==.** But the enormous range of outflow rates that are measured for AGN of the same luminosity, highlights a gaping hole in our understanding of **how outflows are launched and driven**. Our sample of **AGN at similar distances and with similar luminosities, but with outflow rates differing by two orders of magnitude** %%选取样本的特点：在相同光度、距离下，outflow rate相差达到两个量级，进而研究outflow rate%%, provides the ideal opportunity to fill this gap. We will exploit the rich suite of diagnostics at ==5-29um== with MIRI MRS integral field spectroscopy and the sensitivity and resolution of JWST. ==Our analysis is built on the three cornerstones of molecular gas, ionized gas, and dust - observed together at the same resolution over the same scales==, enabling us to build a holistic view of the central few hundred parsecs. From the spatially resolved kinematics we will construct geometrical models that provide a direct view of how gas is fed in from the circumnuclear disk through the obscuring torus and driven out in the outflow. We will **associate the PAHs and the hot dust continuum to each of these components to test new models of the torus**. And from the numerous line ratios, we will quantify the role of **AGN versus stellar photoionization** on the different structures. Piecing this together will enable us to ==highlight the physical processes that determine the prominence of the observed outflow==, leading to a major advance in our understanding of the key mechanisms at the root of AGN fuelling and feedback.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The aim of the observations is to use the MIRI MRS to obtain, for a small sample of AGN, ==spatially resolved distributions and kinematics of various key emission lines, as well as maps of the PAHS and dust==. The target AGN have been chosen to be of similar luminosity and distance, but to cover a wide range of measured outflow rate (reflecting the range of observed line profiles). The observations therefore will be either ==single pointings or small mosaics defined from existing data, designed to cover the circumnuclear disk and the outflow out to scales of at most few hundred parsecs==. The centre of the region of interest for each pointing/mosaic is the bright point source, which indicates the location of the AGN.

==All 3 wavelength settings of MRS will be used==, because the emission lines of interest (which include molecular gas, and both low and high excitation ionized gas) are spread throughout the full MIRI bandpass. All of these are needed in order to perform ==not just kinematic modelling==, but also to model ==the excitation of the molecular and ionized gas==. %%用全部三个波段看分子气体以及高低激发态电离气体%%

Typically, ==a 4-point dither pattern is used==. But for 1 object (NGC5506), the position angle scheduling constraints mean that it is more effective to define an ==8-point linear mosiac along a specific direction==, rather than have 2 dithered pointings.

The AGN are relatively luminous, and mid-infrared imaging shows that the central point source can be very bright. Because of this, and based on the known maxmimum central mid-infrared flux density, the detector set-up for each target has been defined to ==avoid saturation by limiting the number of groups in an integration==. And the ==full intgeration times have been set in order to detect faint extended line emission==, as need for the modelling. Each target can be observed in a single visit.

The necessary separate background observations have been set up with the same detector read-out strategy, and with a 2-point dither in order to ensure that the background frames are optimal.

We will obtain simultaneous imaging in 3 filters. During the MRS background exposures, the SUB256 imager field (this ensures we do not saturate the bright nucleus) is centered on the AGN, ==allowing us to map the continuum and silicate absorption out to larger scales than covered by the MRS.==








## GO 2004 Pressure gradients of the molecular gas and their role in cloud stability in massive outflows driven by black hole jets
**Principal Investigator:** Kalliopi Dasyra
**PI Institution:**  University of Athens
**Allocation:** 6.1 hours
Observing Template: MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy
### TARGET
##### IC 5063
### ABSTRACT
We propose MIRI MRS observations of the ==nearby galaxy IC5063== that will enable us to determine the changes in the ==H2 gas properties== that occur as ==radio jets propagate through a disk and initiate outflows==. We will map the emission of H2 lines in order to derive ==the temperature, the density, and thus the pressure== of the warm and tenuous medium surrounding the ==cold and dense molecular clouds impacted by the jets==. By comparing this pressure map with ==a pressure map from CO(1-0) to (4-3) ALMA data==, we will quantify the changes in the ==external vs. internal pressure== and, thus, in the stability of individual dense clouds after the jet passage. **==We will observationally determine, for the first time, the mass fraction of dense clouds that joins the outflow==**. We will examine whether the dissipation of the dense clouds that leads to their entrainment is primarily due to ==shocks, cosmic rays, or X-rays==. From the density and the velocity of the warm H2, we will obtain ==a lower limit for the outflow duration based on how long ram pressure took to accelerate dense clouds to the observed velocities==. From the mass and the velocity of the warm H2, we will compute the total molecular gas mass that resulted in the halo and got removed from the reservoir available for star formation. Combining gas and dust diagnostics, we will look for star formation variations along the jet. For this project, which will test fundamental physics models of the dense gas acceleration in million or billion solar mass outflows, we ask for ==~2 hours of science time on the JWST==. The observations will have a highly demonstrative value for the telescope, as IC5063 is a well studied galaxy, prototype of jet-driven winds.

### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose for JWST MIRI MRS observations of the local galaxy IC5063, in which ==a radio jet impacts dense molecular clouds as it propagates through the disk.== Outflows are initiated along its propagation path. Our goal is to obtain ==**spatially-resolved information o
n the warm molecular gas properties, such as its density, temperature, and mass**==. This information will enable us to determine the conditions of ==the warm ISM surrounding the dense molecular clouds that are impacted by the radio jet==, and to examine how the pressure of the ==external H2-emitting medium affects the stability of the CO-emitting dense clouds==. The amount of gas originating from dissipated dense clouds and the fraction of the overall warm H2 medium that is lost to the halo and removed from the star formation reservoir will be computed. ==A mosaic is requested comprising both the jet trail and quiescent regions around it, so that spatial gradients between the jet-affected and unaffected regions are quantified==. The mosaic needs to have a position angle between 57 -92 or 237-272 degrees. Sky observations should be executed in an interrupted sequence with the source observations.




## GO 2177 A missing piece of the puzzle: the warm molecular phase of AGN-driven outflows at cosmic noon

### ABSTRACT
An efficient coupling between the energy released by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the interstellar medium (ISM) of their ==host galaxy can generate kpc scales outflows== which may regulate the rate at ==which stars can form and ultimately influence the growth of the galaxy.== These AGN-driven outflows include gas in various phases ==(ionized, atomic, molecular) but at z>1,== due to the limitations of current instrumentation, ==we are forced to adopt a single-phase (ionized) view== of the outflow phenomenon which may lead to wrong estimates of their extent, mass and energetics, therefore ultimately misinterpreting their relevance for galaxy evolution.%%此前只能假定ionized phase，用JWST可以同时考虑ionized，atomic，molecular态%%

The aim of the proposed JWST/MIRI observations is to overcome this limit, and to ==map the mid-infrared ro-vibrational H2 lines to complete the multi-phase characterization== %%多波段观测%%of already well-studied AGN at cosmic noon. ==The three selected AGN have the best available characterization of the ionized component of the outflow at these redshifts==, ==from sub-pc to kpc scales==. With the MIRI observations we will be able to map the warm component of the ISM down to ~2 kpc. We will be able to test model predictions on the enhancement of H2 emission in the presence of cooling of gas shocked by AGN-driven outflow. Ultimately, ==we will derive the total (ionized+molecular) mass outflow rate and kinetic energy== for these outflows which will provide a key constrain on the current models of AGN feedback.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The targets of these observations are three AGN at z~2 with well established ionized outflows from sub-pc to kpc scales.  
We will use ==MIRI MRS to sample the warm molecular phase== of the outflow via H2 transitions with the Long configuration in CH-1  
We will also cover the ==PAH3.3 micron feature in the Long configuration in CH-2==  
We will not perform Targer Acquisition, since the absolute JWST pointing accuracy of 0.1 arcsec is more than sufficient given the size of our targets (~1 arcsec diameter) and the fov of CH-1.

## GO 2547 Quasar Feedback in Action: The Multiphase and Multiscale Outflow of the Most Luminous Quasar in the Local Universe

**Allocation:** 9.0 hours
Observing Template: MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy + NIRSpec IFU Spectroscopy
### TARGET
PDS456
### ABSTRACT
Quasar outflows are among the leading internal ==negative-feedback processes to explain the inside-out quenching of star formation== in massive galaxies and the tight SMBH-spheroid mass relation. The likely culprits, ==the fast-accreting quasars==, ==are common at the epoch of peak SMBH accretion but rare locally==, making it hard to catch and study this negative-feedback phenomenon in action, even with JWST. Fortunately, there is one spectacular exception: PDS 456, ==the most luminous quasar in the local universe==. ==Clear unambiguous signatures of outflows== have been detected in this object on all scales, ranging from the X-ray/UV-detected relativistic wind on sub-pc accretion-disk scales to the galaxy-wide warm-ionized and cold-molecular outflows which extend to at least 10 kpc. The energetics of the outflow indicate that it is potentially able to rapidly quench star formation in the host although the current observations are still missing the critically important ==coronal-ionized, neutral-atomic, and warm-molecular gas phases== to determine if the quasar actually affects the host evolution. The proposed NIRSpec and MIRI data cubes, analyzed with the highly optimized PSF decomposition software package IFSFIT, will allow us to ==(1) get an accurate and complete census of the outflow energetics, (2) constrain the dominant mechanisms that drive this outflow and AGN duty cycle, and (3) characterize the impact of the quasar outflow== and intense radiation field on the physical state of the host ISM, coeval star formation activity, and circumgalactic medium. These exquisite data will serve as a local template to help interpret the coarser data from scheduled GTO/ERS JWST studies of distant quasars.
