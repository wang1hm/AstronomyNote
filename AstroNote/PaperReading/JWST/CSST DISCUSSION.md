### ABSTRACT 
Supermassive black holes, and the outflows they drive, are an established part of our understanding of galaxy evolution. **Indeed, cosmological models rely on outflows to ==reproduce the observed scaling relations==.** But the enormous range of outflow rates that are measured for AGN of the same luminosity, highlights a gaping hole in our understanding of **how outflows are launched and driven**. Our sample of **AGN at similar distances and with similar luminosities, but with outflow rates differing by two orders of magnitude** %%选取样本的特点：在相同光度、距离下，outflow rate相差达到两个量级，进而研究outflow rate%%, provides the ideal opportunity to fill this gap. We will exploit the rich suite of diagnostics at ==5-29um== with MIRI MRS integral field spectroscopy and the sensitivity and resolution of JWST. ==Our analysis is built on the three cornerstones of molecular gas, ionized gas, and dust - observed together at the same resolution over the same scales==, enabling us to build a holistic view of the central few hundred parsecs. From the spatially resolved kinematics we will construct geometrical models that provide a direct view of how gas is fed in from the circumnuclear disk through the obscuring torus and driven out in the outflow. We will **associate the PAHs and the hot dust continuum to each of these components to test new models of the torus**. And from the numerous line ratios, we will quantify the role of **AGN versus stellar photoionization** on the different structures. Piecing this together will enable us to ==highlight the physical processes that determine the prominence of the observed outflow==, leading to a major advance in our understanding of the key mechanisms at the root of AGN fuelling and feedback.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The aim of the observations is to use the MIRI MRS to obtain, for a small sample of AGN, ==spatially resolved distributions and kinematics of various key emission lines, as well as maps of the PAHS and dust==. The target AGN have been chosen to be of similar luminosity and distance, but to cover a wide range of measured outflow rate (reflecting the range of observed line profiles). The observations therefore will be either ==single pointings or small mosaics defined from existing data, designed to cover the circumnuclear disk and the outflow out to scales of at most few hundred parsecs==. The centre of the region of interest for each pointing/mosaic is the bright point source, which indicates the location of the AGN.

==All 3 wavelength settings of MRS will be used==, because the emission lines of interest (which include molecular gas, and both low and high excitation ionized gas) are spread throughout the full MIRI bandpass. All of these are needed in order to perform ==not just kinematic modelling==, but also to model ==the excitation of the molecular and ionized gas==. %%用全部三个波段看分子气体以及高低激发态电离气体%%

Typically, ==a 4-point dither pattern is used==. But for 1 object (NGC5506), the position angle scheduling constraints mean that it is more effective to define an ==8-point linear mosiac along a specific direction==, rather than have 2 dithered pointings.

The AGN are relatively luminous, and mid-infrared imaging shows that the central point source can be very bright. Because of this, and based on the known maxmimum central mid-infrared flux density, the detector set-up for each target has been defined to ==avoid saturation by limiting the number of groups in an integration==. And the ==full intgeration times have been set in order to detect faint extended line emission==, as need for the modelling. Each target can be observed in a single visit.

The necessary separate background observations have been set up with the same detector read-out strategy, and with a 2-point dither in order to ensure that the background frames are optimal.

We will obtain simultaneous imaging in 3 filters. During the MRS background exposures, the SUB256 imager field (this ensures we do not saturate the bright nucleus) is centered on the AGN, ==allowing us to map the continuum and silicate absorption out to larger scales than covered by the MRS.==

##### IC 5063
### ABSTRACT
We propose MIRI MRS observations of the ==nearby galaxy IC5063== that will enable us to determine the changes in the ==H2 gas properties== that occur as ==radio jets propagate through a disk and initiate outflows==. We will map the emission of H2 lines in order to derive ==the temperature, the density, and thus the pressure== of the warm and tenuous medium surrounding the ==cold and dense molecular clouds impacted by the jets==. By comparing this pressure map with ==a pressure map from CO(1-0) to (4-3) ALMA data==, we will quantify the changes in the ==external vs. internal pressure== and, thus, in the stability of individual dense clouds after the jet passage. **==We will observationally determine, for the first time, the mass fraction of dense clouds that joins the outflow==**. We will examine whether the dissipation of the dense clouds that leads to their entrainment is primarily due to ==shocks, cosmic rays, or X-rays==. From the density and the velocity of the warm H2, we will obtain ==a lower limit for the outflow duration based on how long ram pressure took to accelerate dense clouds to the observed velocities==. From the mass and the velocity of the warm H2, we will compute the total molecular gas mass that resulted in the halo and got removed from the reservoir available for star formation. Combining gas and dust diagnostics, we will look for star formation variations along the jet. For this project, which will test fundamental physics models of the dense gas acceleration in million or billion solar mass outflows, we ask for ==~2 hours of science time on the JWST==. The observations will have a highly demonstrative value for the telescope, as IC5063 is a well studied galaxy, prototype of jet-driven winds.

### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose for JWST MIRI MRS observations of the local galaxy IC5063, in which ==a radio jet impacts dense molecular clouds as it propagates through the disk.== Outflows are initiated along its propagation path. Our goal is to obtain ==**spatially-resolved information o
n the warm molecular gas properties, such as its density, temperature, and mass**==. This information will enable us to determine the conditions of ==the warm ISM surrounding the dense molecular clouds that are impacted by the radio jet==, and to examine how the pressure of the ==external H2-emitting medium affects the stability of the CO-emitting dense clouds==. The amount of gas originating from dissipated dense clouds and the fraction of the overall warm H2 medium that is lost to the halo and removed from the star formation reservoir will be computed. ==A mosaic is requested comprising both the jet trail and quiescent regions around it, so that spatial gradients between the jet-affected and unaffected regions are quantified==. The mosaic needs to have a position angle between 57 -92 or 237-272 degrees. Sky observations should be executed in an interrupted sequence with the source observations.

### ABSTRACT
An efficient coupling between the energy released by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the interstellar medium (ISM) of their ==host galaxy can generate kpc scales outflows== which may regulate the rate at ==which stars can form and ultimately influence the growth of the galaxy.== These AGN-driven outflows include gas in various phases ==(ionized, atomic, molecular) but at z>1,== due to the limitations of current instrumentation, ==we are forced to adopt a single-phase (ionized) view== of the outflow phenomenon which may lead to wrong estimates of their extent, mass and energetics, therefore ultimately misinterpreting their relevance for galaxy evolution.%%此前只能假定ionized phase，用JWST可以同时考虑ionized，atomic，molecular态%%

The aim of the proposed JWST/MIRI observations is to overcome this limit, and to ==map the mid-infrared ro-vibrational H2 lines to complete the multi-phase characterization== %%多波段观测%%of already well-studied AGN at cosmic noon. ==The three selected AGN have the best available characterization of the ionized component of the outflow at these redshifts==, ==from sub-pc to kpc scales==. With the MIRI observations we will be able to map the warm component of the ISM down to ~2 kpc. We will be able to test model predictions on the enhancement of H2 emission in the presence of cooling of gas shocked by AGN-driven outflow. Ultimately, ==we will derive the total (ionized+molecular) mass outflow rate and kinetic energy== for these outflows which will provide a key constrain on the current models of AGN feedback.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The targets of these observations are three AGN at z~2 with well established ionized outflows from sub-pc to kpc scales.  
We will use ==MIRI MRS to sample the warm molecular phase== of the outflow via H2 transitions with the Long configuration in CH-1  
We will also cover the ==PAH3.3 micron feature in the Long configuration in CH-2==  
We will not perform Targer Acquisition, since the absolute JWST pointing accuracy of 0.1 arcsec is more than sufficient given the size of our targets (~1 arcsec diameter) and the fov of CH-1.

**Allocation:** 9.0 hours

### TARGET
PDS456
### ABSTRACT
Quasar outflows are among the leading internal ==negative-feedback processes to explain the inside-out quenching of star formation== in massive galaxies and the tight SMBH-spheroid mass relation. The likely culprits, ==the fast-accreting quasars==, ==are common at the epoch of peak SMBH accretion but rare locally==, making it hard to catch and study this negative-feedback phenomenon in action, even with JWST. Fortunately, there is one spectacular exception: PDS 456, ==the most luminous quasar in the local universe==. ==Clear unambiguous signatures of outflows== have been detected in this object on all scales, ranging from the X-ray/UV-detected relativistic wind on sub-pc accretion-disk scales to the galaxy-wide warm-ionized and cold-molecular outflows which extend to at least 10 kpc. The energetics of the outflow indicate that it is potentially able to rapidly quench star formation in the host although the current observations are still missing the critically important ==coronal-ionized, neutral-atomic, and warm-molecular gas phases== to determine if the quasar actually affects the host evolution. The proposed NIRSpec and MIRI data cubes, analyzed with the highly optimized PSF decomposition software package IFSFIT, will allow us to ==(1) get an accurate and complete census of the outflow energetics, (2) constrain the dominant mechanisms that drive this outflow and AGN duty cycle, and (3) characterize the impact of the quasar outflow== and intense radiation field on the physical state of the host ISM, coeval star formation activity, and circumgalactic medium. These exquisite data will serve as a local template to help interpret the coarser data from scheduled GTO/ERS JWST studies of distant quasars.
### OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION

### ABSTRACT
Winds powered by radiation from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are thought to critically affect galaxy evolution. The fate of ==molecular gas in such outflows== is one of the most important unsolved questions in galaxy evolution: if we find that ==winds can entrain, reheat or remove molecular gas from galaxies== we will prove that AGN can quench star formation in its host galaxy and enable the first studies of this key stage of AGN feedback. However, despite years of searches with ground-based telescopes, only a few molecular outflows are known among AGN in the local universe. Here we propose MIRI and NIRSpec IFU observations to spatially resolve the ==molecular gas kinematics in the three most promising hosts of strong molecular outflows identified from Spitzer and SDSS spectroscopy==. These observations will be used in a detailed investigation to reveal if the molecular gas demonstrates the kinematics commensurate with the wind hypothesis. Furthermore, the JWST data will allow the first in-depth studies of the impact of the AGN on the molecular gas in their hosts.%%选源：Spitzer和SDSS看到了强分子outflow的hosts，进而看outflow即agn feedback对星系演化的影响%%
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will be observing three ==local Universe AGN host galaxies== using a combination of NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs. The targets were selected as being very promissing hosts of strong molecular outflows. ==The warm gas phase will be observed through MIR H2 emission lines, while the hot phase is traced by the NIR H2 emission==. Several emission lines from ionized gas will be used to trace the ionized outflows, which will allow us to characterize the multi-phase outflows.

### TARGET

### ABSTRACT
Shocks from nuclear jets in galaxies have profound effects on their interstellar medium, injecting energy from the central Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) which excites and ionizes gas, dissociates molecules, and ablates dust grains. ==Tracers of the shocked gas used to quantify this energy injection can track the response of the interstellar medium to specific forms of feedback.== We propose NIRCam observations of ==nearby Seyfert galaxy NGC 4258== to map these tracers of ionized gas, neutral gas, molecular gas, and dust in the nucleus and inner galactic disk to quantify the impact of the observed ==‘anomalous’ jet on the interstellar medium==. JWST and NIRCam provide a first-ever opportunity to ==observe the impacts of a nuclear jet through the disk of a galaxy at parsec-scale resolution using infrared diagnostics with little extinction by dust.== The comprehensive set of tracers obtained in this program probing the physics of the jet / interstellar medium interaction will provide a detailed picture of feedback in a nearby AGN- hosting galaxy and will inform observations of more distant, high-redshift galaxies whose disks even JWST will be unable to resolve. ==Early cycle JWST imaging of NGC 4258 also provides excellent archival value to the astronomical community, providing a ‘finder-chart’ for specific dynamic regions to be followed-up with future JWST spectroscopic observations.==
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
NGC 4258 will be imaged with NIRCam in filters ==corresponding to six spectral features and associated filters for continuum subtraction==. ==[Fe II] (1.644 um), Paschen-alpha (1.875 um), H_2 (2.12 um), Paschen-beta (4.05 um), and molecular CO (4.66 um)== will be observed with narrowband filters F164N, F87N, F212N, F405N, F466N and the broad polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ==(PAH) 3.3 um== emission line will be observed with the medium F335M filter. ==Medium-band filters F162M, F182M, and F210M== will be used for the continuum subtraction of ==short wavelength== narrow-band filters and ==F300M, F360M, and F430M will be used for continuum subtraction of the long wavelength filters==. ==Three dither positions== in a 2 row x 1 column mosaic will be used to image the extent of the anomalous jet and adjacent unimpacted regions of the galactic disk at any scheduable position angle. The integration times are designed to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratios to detect lines in the faintest portions of the inner disk while not saturating in the nucleus, resulting in a total charged time of 24 hours.

### ABSTRACT
When galactic outflows are triggered, what is the ==impact of feedback on the interstellar medium at the launch site==? How much ==energy== is transported into the ==circumnuclear regions== and subsequently affect the ==dust geometry== and ==metal distribution==? What drives these winds and how do they depend on ==intrinsic AGN propertie==s or ==nuclear star formation rates==? Addressing these pressing questions will have a profound impact on our understanding of the role of feedback in galaxy evolution, and can only be answered observationally using ==high spatial- and spectral-resolution infrared instruments== -- capable of peering through heavy dust screens into galactic nuclei where powerful outflows are launched -- finally made available with JWST.

Capitalizing on the unparalleled diagnostic capability MIRI exhibits over the full 5-28 micron range, our proposed MRS observations of ==7 nearby luminous infrared galaxies== known to ==host prominent shocked molecular outflows== will provide a holistic view of the ==molecular gas, dust, AGN, star formation, and metallicity== in the central 4 kpc of ongoing galaxy mergers at the scales of 30-90 pc. We will determine the heating mechanisms for and gauge energetics of the outflows, correlate their spatial properties with AGN strength, and map their influence on metal distribution and star formation in different environments spanning a range of bolometric AGN fraction, infrared luminosities, and merger class. The 4x better spectral resolution of MRS over Spitzer IRS carries discovery potential in mapping the ionization state of the outflows.%%已知的7个较近的有molecular outflow的源%%

Proprietary data rights are waived to enhance the data's legacy value and to facilitate Cycle 2 proposals for the community.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose MIRI MRS observations for 7 sources in our sample of ==(U)LIRGs==. Two of these sources will be observed as part of a GTO (IRAS F17207-0014; ID 1204, PI Rieke; covering only the short (A) sub-band within MRS) or an ERS (NGC 7469; ID 1328, PI Armus;covering all MIRI modes with sufficient exposure depth for our science goals) program, so we are ==proposing full 528m MIRI MRS observations for the remaining targets==. We will fully utilize the wavelength range of four MRS channels for the suite of ==diagnostic lines== accessible within 5-28m.

We will adopt the ==4-point dither== pattern optimized for an extended source for better sampling of the PSF with relatively uniform coverage. Since our targets span the ==FOV==, we request an off-target observation with a 2-point dither pattern to reduce overheads while providing proper background subtraction for each source. The Background pointing and the Science observation are linked in an uninterruptible sequence for this purpose. ==Simultaneous MIRI imaging of another part of the host galaxy will be obtained in F560W, F770W, and F1500W band==s, useful for improving astrometry and facilitating other ancillary science goals (i.e. mapping PAH features at F770W and dust temperature distribution using F560W and F1500W).

### TARGET
ESO 420-G13
### ABSTRACT
We propose JWST/MIRI medium resolution spectroscopic observations of the ==multi-phase outflow== in ESO 420-G13 to obtain: i) ==the mass and the energy== budget for both the ==ionized and the molecular wind== components; ii) the first ==IR-based determination of the chemical abundances== and the ==metal-loading factor== in a AGN-driven outflow. The mass and the energy budget will then be compared with current AGN feedback simulations, to determine ==the role of the ionized wind in the acceleration and dispersion of the molecular gas and the origin of the outflowing material.== IR-based metallicities in the outflow of ESO 420-G13 can provide the first direct evidence of whether AGN-driven outflows ==regulate the content of heavy elements in galaxies.== Chemical abundances based on IR transitions are insensitive to the dust obscuration and the temperature effects that introduce serious biases in ==stratified and inhomogeneous nebulae==, conditions that are expected when a strong galactic wind is present. This study will provide unique insight into the feedback processes in ==low-luminosity AGN==, the most common form of activity in the nearby Universe. ESO 420-G13 represents ==one of the two cases where a radio-elusive jet has been revealed through its interaction with the ISM==, and the only one where ==the ionized phase of the outflow has been revealed in the [NeII] 12.8 micron emission line==, distinguishing this source as an ideal laboratory to study the supermassive black hole-ISM interaction with JWST.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the ==ionized and molecular gas outflow in the low-luminosity AGN ESO 420-G13==, to derive the mass and the energy budget for both components and provide the first IR-based measurement of the ==chemical abundances== and the ==metal-loading factor== in an AGN-driven wind. ==Our main goal is to characterize the AGN feedback mechanism, determine the origin of the outflowing material, and probe whether AGN-driven outflows are able to regulate the content of heavy elements in galaxies.== Mosaic observations of the central 6"x6" (1.5 x 1.5 kpc2) using a 4-point dither pattern are proposed for the three dichroic settings, to cover the bridge between the inner ionized outflow detected in the [NeII] 12.8 micron line with VLT/VISIR and the cold molecular ==gas outflow detected in CO(2-1)== with ALMA. A dedicated sky acquisition is included to subtract the background contribution, to be executed next to the science acquisition. No other special requirements are requested. The total exposure time is 45 min., corresponding to a total observing time of 4.0 hours including the overheads.

### ABSTRACT
The evolution in the mass accretion rate and density of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) shows that the ==SMBHs in today's most massive galaxies formed in a relatively short time after the Big Bang.== This biased growth of massive galaxies and SMBHs requires ==rapid accretion in the early Universe==, coupled with a ==strong influence of SMBH activity on the hosts== through powerful radio jets and radiation-driven winds. Luminous radio galaxies offer ideal laboratories for studying both modes of AGN ‘feedback’ and where the ==AGN does not outshine its host galaxy== (unlike for quasars). With the NIRSpec/IFU it is now possible for the first time to ==spatially resolve the impact of AGN radio jets on their host galaxies in the rest-frame optical at z > 4.==

We will target ==the rest-frame optical emission of two of the most distant, prototypical radio galaxies==, TN J1338- 1942 (z=4.11) and TGSS J1530+1049 (z=5.72). We will spatially ==resolve the ionization state, kinematics and metallicity== of the gas to constrain how AGN with large-scale radio jets inject energy and modify star-formation in the presence of infall and ==AGN- and starburst-driven winds==. The data will also constrain the ==stellar populations, delineate the host galaxy morphologies, and detect broad emission lines in scattered light== to derive black hole masses. Both objects will be observed with ==NIRCam in GTO to study their larger Mpc-scale environments==. Together these programs will allow us to derive a complete picture of the evolution of some of the most massive and powerful radio AGN known in the early universe, from their energetic cores to their wider cosmic environments.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
==NIRspec/IFU observations of two high redshift targets.== Target TNJ1338-1942 will be observed with ==two dispersers (G235H and G395H)== and by nodding off the source for background subtraction. Target TGSS J1530+1049 will be observed with ==one disperser (G395H)== and by nodding on the source.

We use the readout pattern NRSIRS2 with 16 groups per integration, 2 integrations and ==4 dither points== for the target group TN J1338-1942-GRP which includes the target and the nod off-scene background pointing. We use the readout pattern NRSIRS2 with 19 groups per integration, 5 integrations and 4 dithers for the target TGSS J1530+1049, which will have nod in-scene background subtraction using the 4-point nod.

We do not require target acquisition as TN J1338-1942 has available deep HST as well as ==high-resolution radio imagin==g, and TGSS J1530+1049 has Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio imaging available with sub-arcsecond resolution.%%不需要很高的射电波段光谱数据，已经有HST和VLBI的数据了，主要是补齐NIR的光谱%%

### ABSTRACT
Actively accreting supermassive black holes (AGN) can have ==significant impact on the evolution of their host galaxies through feedback== in the form of gas winds and radio jets which can be seen on ==kpc scale,== encompassing the entire galaxy. We propose here to determine the impact of ==powerful AGN on their host galaxies at Cosmic Noo==n where the co-moving density of luminous AGN is at its peak. Our sample consists of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs), the only AGN population, in which ==quasar-mode feedback, radio-mode feedback and the host galaxies can be characterised simultaneously.== We will use the JWST to 'zoom into' some of the most massive and active galaxies at the onset of the peak of star-formation and AGN activity to address the long-standing question on ==how exactly AGN-driven outflows propagate into the host galaxy and how small-scale phenomena close to the central engine reflect on the large-scale jet and gas characteristics==. The diffraction-limited resolution of JWST and two-dimensional coverage with NIRSpec IFU will provide a ==10-fold improvement in resolution over existing observations and will allow us to map the stellar, gas, and excitation components of distant HzRGs== all at once for the first time. It is critically important to compare ==local AGN with what happens near the start of the peak of the cosmic star formation rate density== at comparable sub-kpc scale resolution, and with exactly the same diagnostics. Our sample at the “sweet spot” redshift ==~3.5== is uniquely suited to do this, covering the critical wavelength regime between ==[OII] and H-alpha even including [SII]== in just one spectral setting with the NIRSpec G235H/F170LP.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will be observing four high-redshift radio galaxies at z ~ 3.5 using the NIRSpec IFUs. The main goal is to ==spatially map the emission lines from [OII] to H-alpha and [SII]== that are all covered in just ==one spectral setting (G235H/170LP)==.

### ABSTRACT
Understanding the ouflows driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is of key importance for the modern view of galaxy evolution. A recent paradigm shift in our picture of ==dust in the vicinity of AGN== offers promise for outflow science. We now know that a major part of an AGN's mid- infrared ==(MIR) dust emission== comes from a ==polar structure that arises in a radiatively-accelerated dusty wind==. Ground-based work has shown that similar polar emission is also found hundreds of pc away from the nucleus. ==If we can confirm that this extended polar emission is fundamentally connected to the pc-scale dusty wind, it will be our best evidence yet for a coherent dynamical connection between nuclear and galaxy-scale outflows.==

This proposal will employ MIRI multi-filter imaging to unravel the nature of AGN-heated emission beyond the central ==100 parsec==. It relies on the unparalleled surface-brightness sensitivity of JWST, a strength that the best ground-based instruments cannot match. Our 8 targets are ==well-studied nearby Seyferts that already have established polar dust detections==, and are carefully selected for their ==high-resolution ancillary data== (HST imaging, AO-assisted and ALMA 3D spectroscopy).%%为了看AGN周围polar dust emission和百pc范围的dust是不是在根本上一样，进而证明AGN feedback影响星系，选源是已经有well polar dust detection，有HST等辅助数据%%

The new JWST data will reveal the structure and colors of the extended dust. We will compare the geometry of the dust to the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations, determine its masses and energy content using ==state-of-the-art radiative transfer models,== and explore its grain composition using novel diagnostics of broad-band spectral features. Along with ancillary kinematic information, we will test the salient hypothesis that ==the extended dust emission is shaped by a nuclear outflow.==
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The proposed observations consist of MIRI imager exposures in multiple bands over the central regions of ==eight (8) nearby Seyfert galaxies==. The targets are bright extended galaxies and all have bright point sources that account for most of their central mid-infrared flux.

Our science goals investigate the nature of the ==low surface-brightness extended warm dust emission.==  
We require 5 filterbands (F560W, F1000W, F1500W, F1800W, F2100W) for a detailed study of ==resolved spectral energy distributions, temperature modelling, and dust mass estimation.==

==We adopt a strategy of short ramps (Ngroup = 5) and many integrations (Nint = 50) to minimise saturation of the central point source, while obtaining sufficiently deep exposures sensitive to the extended emission.== %%？为什么这样就能避免%%We will use the SUB256 imaging subarray, which has a suitable field of view for our goals coupled with a FAST readout mode.

Our science pointings are centered on our targets and take a 4-point dither strategy optimised for point-sources to allow for background estimation, the treatment of detector flatfields, and central point source modelling and subtraction. In order to accurately remove the thermal backgrounds which will affect the three long wavelength bands, we will also take exposures of a nearby background field for all our targets, with an identical readout configuration and a 2-point dither to remove source structure in the field.

### TARGET
PDS456
### ABSTRACT
Quasar outflows are among the leading internal ==negative-feedback processes to explain the inside-out quenching of star formation== in massive galaxies and the tight SMBH-spheroid mass relation. The likely culprits, ==the fast-accreting quasars==, ==are common at the epoch of peak SMBH accretion but rare locally==, making it hard to catch and study this negative-feedback phenomenon in action, even with JWST. Fortunately, there is one spectacular exception: PDS 456, ==the most luminous quasar in the local universe==. ==Clear unambiguous signatures of outflows== have been detected in this object on all scales, ranging from the X-ray/UV-detected relativistic wind on sub-pc accretion-disk scales to the galaxy-wide warm-ionized and cold-molecular outflows which extend to at least 10 kpc. The energetics of the outflow indicate that it is potentially able to rapidly quench star formation in the host although the current observations are still missing the critically important ==coronal-ionized, neutral-atomic, and warm-molecular gas phases== to determine if the quasar actually affects the host evolution. The proposed NIRSpec and MIRI data cubes, analyzed with the highly optimized PSF decomposition software package IFSFIT, will allow us to ==(1) get an accurate and complete census of the outflow energetics, (2) constrain the dominant mechanisms that drive this outflow and AGN duty cycle, and (3) characterize the impact of the quasar outflow== and intense radiation field on the physical state of the host ISM, coeval star formation activity, and circumgalactic medium. These exquisite data will serve as a local template to help interpret the coarser data from scheduled GTO/ERS JWST studies of distant quasars.
### OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION
We will observe PDS 456 using the NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs with the following settings:

-NIRSpec IFU with G235H/F170LP

1 leakage exposure at one dither position: 11 min

-MIRI IFU with the SHORT, MEDIUM, and LONG wavelength settings  
data acquisition starts on the quasar itself (with FND filter), before a shift 0.5" S to capture blobs A and B 4-point all-wavelength extended source dither pattern

### TARGET
NGC 4151
### ABSTRACT
The discovery of a number of black hole (BH) galaxy relations has shown that ==the growth of supermassive BHs is closely related to the evolution of galaxies.== This evidence has opened a new debate in which the fundamental questions concern the interactions between the central BH and the interstellar medium within the host galaxy, and can be addressed by studying two crucial processes: ==feeding and feedback==. Using archival JWST NIRSpec data, we aim to characterize the circumnuclear region of NGC 4151 to study, with unprecedented detail AGN feeding and feedback. NGC 4151, as one of the nearest AGN and an extremely well-studied Seyfert galaxy, provides an outstanding opportunity to obtain meaningful constraints for models incorporating these processes to regulate ==BH-host galaxy co-evolution==. We will achieve this by: (1) tracing outflows via ionized and coronal gas emission to establish the energetics of the outflowing gas and potential for feedback into the host galaxy, (2) tracing inflows via molecular hydrogen gas emission from which the driving inflow mechanism can be identified and an inflow rate obtained via modeling, (3) using the wide range of available H2 lines in the near-IR to establish their connection with the obscuring torus, and (4) obtaining a molecular gas-based black hole mass estimate. JWST is uniquely capable of advancing our understanding of these processes due to its sensitivity and stable point-spread-function, which facilitates the detection of diagnostic emission lines not available in current ground based data, as well as probing these processes down to unprecedented spatial scales.

### ABSTRACT
We propose to observe ==two z~6 quasars== with NIRCam to prove the detectability of their host galaxies. High-z quasars outshine their hosts at ==rest frame UV/optical wavelengths==. ==Observing the underlying host galaxy emission has eluded HST, even with advanced PSF-modelling techniques.== However, detailed simulations predict that the improved resolution of JWST/NIRCam will result in successful detections of these host galaxies for the first time, with our observational strategy predicted to ==yield optimal detections==. The two quasars selected for this pilot program were ==comprehensively studied with HST and ALMA==, and are expected to have ==relatively low contrast between the quasar and host, improving detectability.== %%选的是已经有HST和ALMA观测的源，且quasar和host的contrast较小，探测更好%%The proposed pilot program will demonstrate the capability of JWST to observe high-z quasar host galaxies, and provide valuable insight into the growth of black holes and galaxies in the early Universe, and of the relationships between black holes and their host galaxies.

With these NIRCam data we will:  
(a) ==Characterize the rest frame UV/optical SEDs of these quasar host galaxies==, determining their star formation histories and dust content  
(b) Determine the stellar mass of the hosts, allowing us to ==measure the black hole–stellar mass ratio for high-z quasars for the first time==  
(c) Compare the ==stellar (JWST) and gas (ALMA) properties== of the galaxies such as their star formation rates, sizes, morphologies and masses, to see the full picture of these host galaxies  
(d) Study the ==environments of these high-z quasars==, photometrically identifying and characterizing any potential companion galaxies.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose to obtain NIRCam photometry of the two quasars SDSS J0129-0035 at z=5.78 and SDSS J2054-0005 at z=6.04, with the aim of detecting and characterising their host galaxies. We will use the ==F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W and F444W filters==, with exposure times of ==7.5 ks 
for the short-wavelength filters and 5 ks for the long-wavelength filters==. %%为什么长波短波曝光时间不一样？%%These will be observed with the ==8-point small-grid dither pattern for accurate sub-pixel sampling of the PSF.==

Alongside these quasar observations, we will ==observe two stars to accurately characterize the instrument PSF,== to be used for detailed point-source modelling of the quasar to detect the underlying host galaxy. These PSF stars SDSS J0132-0002 and SDSS J2130+0028 are chosen as they are ==M-type stars with colors very similar to those of the quasars, so as to minimize chromatic PSF errors==. They are faint enough to be detected with the NIRCam full array, are close to the quasars on the sky, and are single stars with no nearby contaminating objects. These PSF stars will be observed directly after the quasar observations, and at the same position angle and similar position on the detector, to minimize any temporal or spatial variation in the PSF so that the quasar PSF is modelled as accurately as possible.

### ABSTRACT
We propose NIRSpec Fixed-Slit + NIRCam broad-band observations of ==12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars known at z=6 to obtain the first full census of the black holes and host galaxies of the earliest quasars.== We will derive the ==well-calibrated Hbeta-based masses (M_BH)== of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with NIRSpec's G395M grism, from which we ==characterize the distribution functions of M_BH and Eddington ratios==, eliminating severe previous selection biases due to the limitation of ground-based NIR spectroscopy. We will measure their ==host stellar masses== with NIRCam's F150W and F356W filters to calculate the ==SMBH-to-stellar mass ratios==, from which we investigate the origin of the tight correlation between M_BH and host bulge mass observed ==in the present-day universe==. ==Our sample size will allow us to stringently determine whether SMBHs have grown in parallel with their hosts== (as suggested by recent ALMA observations), or ==if one evolves faster than the other==. Our sample is the least biased of all high-z quasar samples, allowing us to derive a comprehensive picture of the SMBHs and their host galaxies within the first billion years of the universe.%%选高红移目前已知最弱的源以避免bias，进而看早期SMBH-to-stellar mass ratio和现在的宇宙有没有区别，和ALMA对比%%
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
This program is a joint NIRSpec Fixed-Slit Spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging of 12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars known at z=6, beyond the sensitivity limits of ground-based near-infrared spectroscopy (y=23-24 AB mag). The NIRSpec observations with the G395M grism are designed to cover the redshifted ==Hbeta emission line at 3.44-3.60 micro==n and its underlying continua, from which robust virial masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will be measured with the single-epoch method. The NIRCam imaging with F150W and F356W filters straddling the 4000 Angstrom breaks will enable us to measure the ==stellar masses and stellar populations of the host galaxies==, after carefully subtracting the PSF components in the broad-band images. The 2D PSF+galaxy decomposition will give us an ==estimate of the stellar light contamination to the observed continuum fluxes== in the NIRSpec spectrum covering the same wavelength range. ==Thanks to the low luminosities of our sample, the black hole masses and stellar properties of the host galaxies will constrain the mass distribution function and the stellar-to-SMBH mass ratios of the z=6 quasars for the first time.==%%？为什么low luminosities就可以限制质量分布函数以及stellar-to-SMBH mass ratios了%%

### ABSTRACT
AGN have become key components of most galaxy evolution models, yet several open issues remain in our understanding of ==how the link between galaxies and their SMBHs is established and maintained==. We propose to survey the host demographics of AGN during the ==first quarter of cosmic tim==e in order to understand ==when and how the AGN-galaxy connection is established.== Our study will use data from the ==CEERS ERS program==, whose NIRCam, MIRI and NIRSpec observations will enable a wide range of AGN-related science. We will use ==a combination of X-ray data and CEERS MIRI and NIRSpec data to create a multiwavelength sample of AGN== and use it to conduct the following science: (1) ==NIRCam imaging will provide rest-frame optical morphologies of AGN hosts at z=2-6.== We will trace the emergence of bulge and disk structures and their connection to SMBH growth during the era of galaxy assembly and determine the role that ==galaxy mergers play in fueling AGN activity== during this epoch. (2) We will use ==MIRI color diagnostics== to perform a census of obscured SMBHs out to z=2, revealing the properties of this previously ==hidden population and determining how the fraction of obscured AGN evolves with redshift.== (3) We will use NIRSpec data to conduct a survey of ==AGN-driven outflows== at z>3 and measure the impact they have on their host galaxies. (4) We will search for the ==seeds== of today's SMBHs at Cosmic Dawn by using NIRSpec to find high ionization lines from growing SMBHs at z>7. As part of our science analysis, we will ==release value-added catalogs of morphologies, emission line fluxes, and AGN identifications to supplement the CEERS dataset and directly enable future community use of JWST.==

### ABSTRACT
The measurement of the ==scaling relations between supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass and the properties of the host galaxy at cosmic noon (z~2)== is crucial to understanding the co-evolution (or not) of ==SMBHs and galaxies, the nature of AGN feedback and self-regulated BH growth, and the forecast for the stochastic gravitational wave background from mergers of SMBHs==. Given the difficulties of acquiring both reliable BH masses and host galaxy measurements in this regime, ==there is currently no consensus on whether or not such correlations exist at z~2.== We propose pioneering JWST NIRCam ~1-5 micron imaging and NIRSpec IFU ~1-2 micron spectroscopy to ==constrain the correlations between SMBH mass and host stellar velocity dispersion, stellar mass and luminosity,== using a unique sample of ==ten z~2 quasars with BH masses measured directly from reverberation mapping==.%%选源：10个z=2的有反响映射黑洞质量的quasar%% This pilot JWST program is poised to deliver the most definitive constraints on the high-z SMBH-galaxy scaling relations to date, paving the way for future more ambitious programs. It will also enable a broad range of science, ==from stellar populations of massive quasar host galaxies, to kpc-scale quasar-driven outflows (e.g., in [OIII]5007), and provide a benchmark sample for comparative studies of massive galaxies at z~2== (e.g., star- forming and quiescent galaxies, obscured AGN hosts, etc).
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will perform NIRCam imaging and NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy for ten z~2 quasars with direct black hole mass estimates based on reverberation mapping. The NIRCam imaging is primarily used to measure morphology, local environment, and stellar populations of the hosts upon imaging decomposition in multiple bands. The NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy is primarily used to measure the stellar velocity dispersion and [O III] kinematic maps. The ten targets are all within a 1.5-deg-radius field so slew overhead is insignficant.

Each target will have two observations, and each observation can be fit in a single visit. All targets can be considered compact sources (with sizes <1") in sparse extragalactic fields. All targets are relatively bright, with average J-band magnitude of 19.2 (Vega).

The first visit/observation is NIRCam imaging in two pairs of short+long-wave filters (F090W+F277W, F150W+F444W). We will use the SUB640 subarray and offset the target to avoid the central detector gaps. For each filter combination, we will adopt a 4-point STANDARD subpixel dither pattern and a total exposure time of ~480 or ~320 sec. This dither pattern is sufficient to reach Nyquist sampling of the PSF for all filters but F090W, whose PSF is still slightly undersampled. This compromise is acceptable since the F090W filter samples the rest-frame UV and is not primarily used for morphological measurements and stellar mass estimation. Increasing the number of dither points will lead to substantial extra overhead with minimal improvements for our primary science goals. We will use field stars in all NIRCam pointings for the ten targets to construct a composite PSF reference for our quasar/host decomposition.

The second visit/observation is the NIRSpec IFU spectroscopy. We will use the G140M/F100LP setup. No PSF subtraction is required for the IFU observations. No instrument-level target acquisition is required given the compact sizes of our targets and the pointing accuracy. We will use a 4- point dither pattern with a total exposure time of ~2400 sec. For each visit we will include a WAVECAL exposure. The sky background can be considered uniform for our targets and the background level is sufficiently low for our targets, therefore MSA leakage is not important (only mild fractional increase in background level) and we do not require a separate MSA leakcal exposure. We will manually process the dithered exposures for background subtraction if necessary.

### TARGET
SGR-A
### ABSTRACT
Flows in the accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes are central to virtually all observations of these objects, as well as to the consequences they have on their environments. This topic is complex because ==accretion disks are three-dimensional, turbulent, frequently self- gravitating, and strongly influenced by magnetic fields==. Furthermore, in nearly all cases the system is too distant for detailed study. Sgr A* provides a unique laboratory to study this process through detailed imaging of the effects of the black hole on its environment, given that ==it is orders of magnitude closer than any other example.== We will answer a key question about models of the accretion disk around Sgr A*, namely whether ==purely thermal or hybrid thermal/nonthermal models are appropriate==. This ambiguity arises because ==plasma instabilities can accelerate electrons and push the electron distribution function into a non-thermal state==. Hybrid models predict UV fluxes 3 orders of magnitude higher in that case than pure thermal models. We will make a definitive test of this prediction using a ==very deep search for the [Ne VI] line, ionization potential 126 eV, at 7.64 microns==. This result fills in a key aspect of the theory of the nearest, and best studied, super-massive black hole and its accretion disk.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will ==characterize the nature of the accretion disk around Sgr A* with mid-infrared IFU observations== using the MIRI/MRS. Our goal is to ==observe the mid-IR emission line of [NeVI] at 7.64 m in a nearby gas cloud==, which is ==excited by the strong UV emission of the thermal or non-thermal electron distribution within the black hole’s accretion disk==. The observed line-strength is directly set by the UV emission profile of the electron distribution function (eDF), therefore, ==we have a unique opportunity with JWST to understand the physics in the accretion disk of our Milky Way’s central black hole.==

### TARGET
M-87
### ABSTRACT
The central black hole (BH) of the giant elliptical galaxy M87 has been studied for more than 40 years. ==Similar to Sgr A* at the Galactic Center==, the remarkable increase in angular resolution over the years, culminating in the Event Horizon Telescope image of the M87 BH shadow, has paved the way for a deeper understanding of the compact object and the immediate surrounding environment. ==The EHT image also provided an independent measurement of the M87 BH mass, which is consistent with the most recent stellar-dynamical result but differs by a factor of ~2 from the gas- dynamical determination==. On the surface, the agreement between the EHT and most recent stellar-dynamical BH mass provides an important validation of the stellar-dynamical technique, but it is pressing to scrutinize the apparent agreement further because both measurements ==relied on extensive modeling and built-in assumptions==. We propose to acquire the best high angular resolution spectra to date at the center of M87 using the NIRSpec integral field unit (IFU). ==We will study parsec-scale stellar dynamics around the M87 BH and extract reliable kinematics deep within the BH gravitational potential==. When combined with existing large-scale IFU stellar kinematics and a new, fully general, triaxial, orbit-based modeling approach, we will obtain the most robust stellar-dynamical BH mass for M87. We will further carry out a comprehensive analysis of the error budget, incorporating possible systematic effects. M87 is a pivotal anchor for the upper end of the BH mass - host galaxy relations, and it is crucial to obtain the best possible BH mass measurement.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will observe the center of M87 using NIRSpec in IFU mode with the G235H/F170LP grating and filter. The wavelength range will cover the K- band CO bandheads, from which we will measure the stellar kinematics as a function of spatial location. We will obtain dithered NIRSpec exposures using the cycling pattern and small extent, thereby improving the sampling of the NIRSpec point spread function. We select the NRIRS2 readout mode to reduce correlated noise and increase sensitivity for long exposures, while keeping the data volume low to ensure schedulability.

Our work requires high signal-to-noise (S/N) spectra in order to fully characterize the stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution. We will measure not only the velocity and velocity dispersion, but also higher order moments (h_3, h_4, and beyond) that quantify the distribution's asymmetric and symmetric deviations from a Gaussian. Using the JWST ETC, and the surface brightness profile from Kormendy et al. 2009, we estimate that ~6.6 hrs is needed to reach a S/N ~ 100 at 2.3 microns in a circular aperture with a radius of 0.014" located 0.15" from the nucleus. The aperture was selected to mimic a single spaxel, which will be 0.025"x0.025" in size with our dithering strategy. We will construct spatial bins in the outer regions of the NIRSpec IFU to reach a similarly high S/N. We will use 20 groups (each consisting of 5 frames with our readout mode), 1 integration, and 16 (dithered) exposures.

We will obtain a LeakCal exposure composed of 20 groups with the NRIRS2 readout mode at the first science dither postion. This exposure will be used to remove MSA leakage. Since we expect the background to be fairly uniform over the small extent of the dither pattern, we chose not to obtain LeakCal exposures at every dither position. We also will perform a target acquisition to ensure precise centering on the galaxy nucleus.

### ABSTRACT
We propose to monitor the ==near-IR flare emission of Sgr A*== at two wavelengths using NIRCam imaging. The observations will consist of ==2 12-hour episodes to be carried out simulataneously with observations by ALMA and the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)==. ==Simultaneous measurements at 2.1 and 4.8 microns provide the spectral evolution of IR flare emission==. This yields information about the ==particle acceleration process and subsequent synchrotron cooling of the highest-energy particles==. Using an adiabatic expansion model, ==the IR light curve== can then be used to determine the spectrum and the variability of submm emission across the multiple flares that are likely during the course of the EHT observations. ==The predicted submm variability is a necessary component in being able to construct an image of the black hole shadow from the EHT observations.== The proposed simultaneous IR and submm observations of the variability of Sgr A* will be key to the EHT's success.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will use the NIRCam in imaging mode to obtain observations centered on the SMBH Sgr A* at the Galactic Center (GC). ==Simultaneous imaging will be obtained in the short- and long-wavelength channels, using Module B only, and the SUB640 subarray readout==. Subarray readouts are used to reduce data volume and decrease the exposure time per group, because of the bright sources located near Sgr A*. The F210M and F480M filters will be used to obtain photometry of Sgr A* at two different wavelengths simultaneously, thus ==allowing for measurments of the spectral index of Sgr A* as well==. Using the RAPID readout mode, with the SUB640 subarray, ==we will obtain 10 groups per integration and 20 integrations per exposure==, in conjunction with a 4-point dither pattern. Each block of 4 dithered exposures will cover ~1 hour of observing. We will obtain 9 such exposure blocks in a back-to-back fashion, which will provide ~12 hours of coverage on the target. Two such 12 hour visits will be obtained, both of which will be coordinated with times at which other telescopes in the EHT campaign (such as ALMA) are observing Sgr A*.

### ABSTRACT
We propose to obtain high-resolution NIRspec fixed slits (FS) spectroscopy and MIRI low-resolution slit spectroscopy (LRS) for newly discovered ==infrared-dropout X-ray sources==%%？只在x-ray有观测的意思？%% (i.e., without any optical/NIR counterparts) in the COSMOS field. This is ==possibly the first population of accreting black holes==, and/or heavily obscured AGNs at high redshift, providing a valuable observational constraint on a hidden phase of a significant growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the early universe. Considering that our targets are optically dark, the JWST spectroscopy is the only instrument allowing to obtain the ==high-resolution IR spectra to detect the emission lines to confirm the spectroscopic redshift and classification for these sources.== This proposed study will allow us to explore the most energetic and obscured phase of accreting black holes to understand the formation of SMBHs. Our program will facilitate the first detailed study of yet unknown heavily obscured population at early cosmic epoch.%%确认一个可能是最高红移的目标，infrared-dropout x-ray sources%%
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will use NIRspec FS high-resolution spectroscopy for 7 objects with robust Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 and 4.5um detections to identify the nature of these sources, whether they are really ==direct collapse black holes (DCBHs)== or a yet ==undiscovered population of heavily obscured black holes at high redshift==. Our primary goal is to detect emission lines in order to obtain the spectroscopic redshift, as well as some other features, e.g., broad-lines and/or outflows. We will use the grating/filter combination of G395M/F290LP with FULL/NRSIRS2RAPID. By using the ==dual slit dither (S200A1 and S200A2)==, we will obtain complete wavelength coverage from ==2.87um to 5.14um in high-resolution R~2700==. We will also use MIRI LRS slit spectroscopy for 3 objects, which are detected in all Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS24um bands, to measure their MIR spectra with significant ==S/N, covering 5-12um wavelength ranges with R~100.==

### ABSTRACT
==The physical processes governing the formation of the seeds of supermassive black holes==, as well as ==how they grow in the early universe==, are two fundamental unanswered questions in galaxy formation and cosmology. The unprecedented sensitivity of JWST's instruments hold exciting potential for ==probing the growth of galaxies and black holes (BHs) in the very early Universe==. However, detailed theoretical models are essential for interpreting these observations. With the goal of ==establishing a connection between the "ground-level", small-scale physical processes and the "top-level" observable== signatures, we propose to construct an efficient, physics-based ==modeling pipeline that self-consistently simulates the co-evolution of BHs and galaxies, and produces predictions of their physical and observable properties over a wide redshift and halo mass range==. This will be done by incorporating two essential new components into a well-established galaxy formation framework: 1) a suite of models ==representing different scenarios for BH seed formation and BH accretion==, and 2) ==population synthesis and nebular line emission models== that account for radiation from both stars and accreting BH. ==With this novel modeling pipeline, we will be able== to 1) explore the implications of different BH seeding and accretion models for physical BH and host properties at high redshift, as well as observable quantities such as emission line luminosity functions, colors, and line ratios; 2) identify observables that can optimally constrain seeding and accretion models; and 3) create mock catalogs containing synthetic spectra and photometry, which can guide the design of future JWST observational programs.

### ABSTRACT
We propose to carry out comprehensive JWST observations of the ==only three quasars currently known at z>7.5==, deep into the ==epoch of reionization== (EoR). Luminous quasars at the highest redshift directly probe the formation of the ==earliest supermassive black holes (SMBHs)== in the universe, enable studies of the evolution of early massive galaxies and their connections to SMBH growth, and provide sensitive constraints on the ==state of the intergalactic medium (IGM)== during the EoR not accessible with other probes.

We have carefully designed a JWST program to address outstanding science opportunities that EoR quasars provide, capitalizing on the transformative capabilities of JWST. By employing a combination of imaging and spectroscopic observations using NIRCam, NIRSpec, MIRI and NIRISS, our program will (1) ==detect the stellar continuum and nebular emission of quasar host galaxies== only 680 Myr after the Big Bang, to probe ==host galaxy assembly and to search for signatures of outflow and feedback==, (2) map the ==large scale quasar environment==, to test quasar formation models in the context of early structure formation, (3) yield ==reliable estimates== of the SMBH masses and constrain physical properties of the quasar broad-line regions, and (4) provide the most accurate ==measurement of the IGM neutral fraction== at z=7.5 and detect weak metal absorption features, to map the history of reionization and IGM enrichment.

These three EoR quasars constitute the culmination of decades of searches using all-sky surveys. They are the best JWST targets for quasars at the current redshift frontier and provide the definitive reference dataset for future EoR quasar and IGM science using JWST.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
OBSERVING DESCRIPTION

The primary targets of our observations are the three most distant known quasars, J0313-1806 (z=7.64), J1007+2115 (z=7.52), and J1342+0928 (z=7.54), with a number of different observing modes. Quasar J0313-1806 is a newly discovered unpublished quasar. Quasar J1342+0928 will only be observed with NIRCam and MIRI imaging modes because the other modes we describe below are covered by GTO programs. We will also observe PSF stars for each quasar in the imaging or IFU modes. Below is the summary of the observing plan for each observing mode:

1. NIRCam Imaging (visit 1 and 2): three quasars, 9.1 hours science; 16.7 hours total.

The goal of the ==NIRCam imaging is to detect the quasar host galaxy of these three quasars with accurate PSF subtraction==, and to detect galaxies in the quasar fields.

-- Visit 1: We will observe each of our primary targets with NIRCam imaging in three filter pairs, including three intermediate band and two broad band filters, with a total exposure time of 3768 sec for two pairs and 2802 sec for the other one. Because of the bright central quasar, we will use SHALLOW4 readout mode to avoid saturation. We will use INTRAMODULE three-points dither plus standard three-point subpixel dither pattern to improve the sampling, since our bluest filters are undersampled, and to fill the gaps between the SW detectors. We will use the FULL arrays to maximize the sky coverage to probe the environments of the quasars and to identify additional PSF stars.

-- Visit 2: We will observe a nearby late M-dwarf as our PSF star of each quasar. For the PSF star, we will use a 160P subarray readout and BRIGHT1 readout mode to avoid saturation.

2. MIRI Imaging (visit 3 and 4): three quasars, 4.4 hours science; 7.3 hours total.

-- Visit 3: The goal of the MIRI imaging is to detect the quasar ==host galaxy in the shortest MIRI wavelength filter (F560W)== which covers the H_alpha emission line at z~7.6. We will use FAST readout mode with a four-point dither pattern to improve sampling.

-- Visit 4: We will observe the same PSF star of each quasar as in Visit 2.

3. MIRI MRS (visit 5): quasars J1007+2115 and J0313-1806, 4.2 hours science, 6.8 hours total.

The goal of the MIRI MRS observation is to obtain a high S/N mid-IR spectrum of each quasar to study quasar physics and to use as a quasar spectral template for future high-redshift quasar JWST observations. Therefore, we require a complete MRS wavelength coverage with all three grating settings. We will use SLOW readout mode with 2500 sec exposure in each setting for each quasar. We will carry out simultaneous imaging with MIRI in the F560W filter, which we will use to identify additional field PSF stars.

4. NIRSpec Fixed Slits (FSs) (visit 6): quasars J1007+2115 and J0313-1806, 1.8 hours science, 5.2 hours total.

The goal of the NIRSpec FSs observations is to obtain high quality near-IR spectra, uncontaminated by telluric features, to study IGM reionization and enrichment, and to provide a prototype quasar template for future high-redshift quasar JWST observations. We will use three high resolution settings with both slits (S200A1 and S200A2) to cover the wavelength range redward of rest-frame 1140A of the quasar SED. We will carry out 19 minute exposures in each of the G140H/F100LP, G235H/G170LP, and G395H/F290LP configurations.

5. NIRSpec IFU (visit 7 and 8): quasars J1007+2115 and J0313-1806, 22.6 hours science, 29.6 hours total.

The goal of the NIRSpec IFU observation is to obtain emission line flux and velocity maps of the quasar host galaxy, after PSF subtraction.

-- Visit 7: We will observe our primary targets with the G395M grating with a total integration of 10 hours per target, broken into multiple dithers. We will also carry out a 1.2 hour MSA leakage calibration exposure at the first dither position.

-- Visit 8: We will observe a nearby bright F star as our PSF star for each quasar. We will use RAPID readout mode to minimize overhead.

6. Parallel observations with NIRISS: three quasars, 8.1 hours science.

We request parallel observations in NIRISS imaging mode with NIRCam as the primary instrument in Visit 1. The NIRISS observations will image the field ~ 8-13 cMpc from the central quasar, significantly expanding the survey volume for the quasar environment study. We choose F090W and F115W filters for a dropout selection and will reach a similar depth to the NIRCam imaging. A direct comparison to the dropout sources in the NIRISS and NIRCam fields will provide us with a unique and important constraint on the clustering of galaxies around the three z~7.5 quasars.

### ABSTRACT
Theoretical models predict that luminous quasars should act as ==signposts for protoclusters in the young Universe==. However, despite extensive searching, protoclusters traced by quasars have not yet been discovered in the epoch of reionization (EoR). Recent ALMA/JCMT sub-mm observations and Subaru narrow/broad band imaging of ==a luminous quasar at z=6.63 have finally revealed a spectacular overdensity of [CII] emitters, sub-mm galaxies, and Lyman alpha emitters,%%？为什么这几条线代表了protocluster的quasar activity%% suggesting that it is the most distant known protocluster harboring quasar activity, and the first such system discovered in the EoR==. %%选源：ALMA/JCMT和Subaru看到的一个z=6.63的protocluster有quasar activity%%An approved HST program will mosaic two 3.6'x3.6' fields, centered at the quasar and a galaxy merging system within this protocluster, respectively. The quasar, ==with both strong gas outflow as indicated by broad absorption lines and inflow as indicated by multiple metal absorption lines, is hosted by an extended massive merging galaxy.== Moreover, the quasar host features an ==extremely broad [CII] line with a FWHM of 930 km/s, suggesting that this quasar resides in a deep gravitational potential and could be a progenitor of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG).==%%？为什么极宽的[CII]代表深引力场%%

We propose NIRSpec MSA observations to ==identify galaxies physically associated to this protocluster== by targeting galaxies selected from HST observations. ==The MSA observations will allow us to map the 3D structure of the protocluster==, measure AGN fraction of protocluster member galaxies, and characterize the physical properties of galaxies in the most dense structure yet known in the EoR. In addition, we will perform NIRSpec IFU observation of the quasar to study the formation of the BCG progenitor.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
**Observation 1 - NIRSpec MSA observation of a field around the central luminous quasar**  
This is NIRSpec MSA follow-up of high redshift galaxies selected from HST/WFC3 imaging. The HST observations are scheduled in early 2021 and would give us plenty time to select targets.  
We use the G395M/F290LP setup for observing Hbeta, [OIII] 4959, 5007, and Halpha emission lines of galaxies at z=6.6. The MSA observation will also target the luminous quasar, which will deliver a very high quality spectrum of the quasar.  
We also perform coordinated parallel observations with NIRCam. We use the F115W+F356W and F070W+F444W combinations to select z~6.6 galaxies in an additional sky area within this giant protocluster.

**Observation 2 - NIRSpec MSA observation of a field centered at a merging system in the protocluster** This observation is similar to Observation 1 but centered at a galaxy merger within the protocluster.

**Observation 3 - NIRSpec IFU observations of the central quasar**  
The central quasar has strong outflow and inflow features and is hosted by a massive galaxy merger. We will use the IFU G395H/F290LP to map the strongest optical nebular lines (Hbeta, [OIII], Halpha, [NII]). The main science goals of this observation are characterizing the quasar outflow, detecting star formation in quasar host galaxy, and investigating the black hole fueling.

We will observe this object with IFU PRISM/CLEAR for detecting quasar host galaxy in continuum over the whole wavelength range covered by NIRSpec. We include leakcal at the first dither position for the PRISM observation.

We are using no target acquisition (i.e. point-and-shoot) for this observation. At any of the constrained PA range there are Gaia GS that can be selected for guiding and that will ensure the proper location of the target within the IFU aperture, with the required accuracy.

We are using NRSIRS2RAPID for a better identification and rejection of cosmic rays.

### ABSTRACT
The discovery of ==z>7 quasars hosting billion solar mass supermassive black holes (SMBHs) places the strongest constraints on the formation of the earliest SMBHs in the universe.== These quasars are also signposts of the assembly of the early massive galaxies during the epoch of reionization. Is there an upper limit on BH masses and the rate of their growth in the early universe? ==Recently, a luminous quasar at z=7.1 has been discovered to host a SMBH with at least 10 billion solar masses.==%%选源：z=7.1的有10 billion 太阳质量的quasar%% It also shows evidence of strong dust reddening based on ground-based spectroscopy. ==Its rest-frame UV continuum shape is highly unusual, suggestive of extinction due to supernova produced dust.== However, the total extinction is completely unconstrained with ground-based data, ==therefore the SMBH mass is only a lower limit==. We propose to carry out JWST observations to obtain ==its rest-frame optical spectrum and broad-band SED in the near-infrared==. The first goal is to ==accurately measure its BH mass based on its H-beta line and bolometric luminosity fully corrected for extinction==, in order to confirm the first detection of a BH with mass exceeding 10 billion solar masses in the early universe. ==The same data will be used to characterize the nature of dust extinction and test whether supernova dust can explain its continuum shape==. The modest JWST program proposed here will unveil the nature of this remarkable quasar at the epoch of reionization, and provide new insight in the growth of the most massive BHs in the early universe and their connections to galaxy formation.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will use NIRSpec IFU Prism and G395H/F290LP and MIRI imaging modes to observe a new z=7.06 reddened quasar. Given our science goals, estimated using the JWST ECT, the total science time is 2.2 hours, and the total charged time is 5.5 hours.

1. NIRSpec IFU, 1.9 hours sicence, 3.1 hours total  
We choose IFU instead of Fixed Slit mode becuase there is not slit-loss and the overhead time is shorter. Slit-loss will significantly affect the accuracy of extinction curve measurement and also quasar continuum fitting. NRSIRS2RAPID readout mode CYCLING dither are used.

- IFU Prism: this mode is chosen to take spectrscopy in the full wavelength for the study of dust extcintion. With only 0.5 hour on-source integration, we can detect the quasar continuum from 1 micron to 5 micron at S/N>~20 per pixel, which will allow a precise measurement of the dust extinction curve.

- G395H/F290LP: we request 4,726s on-source time to detect the continuum around H-beta and [OIII] lines at S/N >~ 20 per pixel. This S/N is required to measure the continuum and broad line width to 5-10% precision, corresponding to ~20% accuracy in black hole mass measurement.

2. MIRI imaging, 0.3 hours sicence, 2.4 hours total  
All filters will be used with total on-source time of 0.3 hours to have a full wavelength coverage of high quality SED from 5 to 25 micron (rest-frame 0.6 - 3 micron). Four-point dither and FAST readout mode will be used.

### ABSTRACT
Intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) in local low metallicity dwarf galaxies, with masses between one hundred and a million solar masses are crucial to our understanding of ==the origins of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and will give rise to the prime targets for LISA==. Despite their importance, ==very little is known about their mass distribution and the host galaxies in which they reside==. Dynamical studies cannot uncover the lowest masses, and ==accreting IMBHs have eluded detection by optical spectroscopic, mid-infrared color, X-ray, and radio surveys due either to obscuration of the central engine, or dilution of the accretion activity from star formation in the host galaxy.== In fact, there is currently ==no direct evidence for black holes with masses between ~ 150 - 10,000 solar masses==, a gap of roughly two orders of magnitude in mass. In this pilot program, we propose to push the frontier in the low mass regime by observing ==two nearby low mass, low metallicity dwarf galaxies==%%选源：选2个近的低质量低金属丰度的矮星系，可能拥有中等质量黑洞%% with the most convincing evidence yet for optically elusive AGNs in the lowest mass galaxies. Using the NIRSpec IFU, this pilot program is designed to unveil a ~1000 solar mass IMBH, an order of magnitude lower than any other nuclear black hole known in a galaxy thus far and will be the lowest mass galaxy in the Universe known to host an AGN. With a modest investment in observing time, this study can not only make a breakthrough in the IMBH mass frontier, but pave the way to ==discover more elusive AGNs in the low mass regime==. This program can only be carried out using the unique capabilities of JWST.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The goal of this proposal is to obtain near infrared spectroscopy of two dwarf galaxies with compelling evidence for ==optically elusive active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in order to search for coronal lines (CLs)==%%？什么是elusive active galactic nuclei%%, and to obtain intensity and kinematic maps to confirm their hidden AGNs and constrain their properties. To exploit the maximum sensitivity of JWST and observe the infrared CLs with the highest ionization potentials (IPs) that are sensitive to the ionizing SED, we request NIRSpec IFU medium resolution observations in ==two gratings (G235M and G395M)== for our two targets enabling the detection of key diagnostic CLs necessary to achieve our science goals that are impossible to observe from the ground.

Given carefully determined S/N requirements on the various emission lines, we ==request ~3600 sec and ~7100 sec, respectively, for each target with the G235M and G395M grating settings==. We will use NSIRS2RAPID readout with 60 groups & 1 integration at four dither positions for the brighter target and 60 groups & 2 integrations at four dither positions for the fainter target. No saturation issues are expected based on ETC estimates.

Since we are using NIRSpec, LeakCals will be necessary, but because our primary goal is to ==obtain the emission line fluxes==, we follow the recommended LeakCal strategy and will obtain a single LeakCal at only one position with the same exposure time as our observation. Based on the expected pointing accuracy of JWST and the fact that our targets have SDSS coordinates, we will not be requiring any target acquisition; our targets are compact and will fit completely in the NIRSpec 3"x3" FOV. We will also be able to perform background subtraction within the FOV, increasing the efficiency of our program.

### ABSTRACT
At ==z>6== (when the Universe is <1 Gyr old), ==luminous quasars are exceptionally active: their central engine is a rapidly accreting supermassive== (~1e9 Msun) black hole which resides in an intensely star-forming galaxy that is ab order of magnitude more massive than typical galaxies at these redshifts. How can we account for such a ==rapid growth== of these extreme sources? The exceptional quasar PJ308-21 may offer an answer. ==High-resolution HST and ALMA imaging demonstrates that the quasar host is undergoing a merger with one or more satellite galaxies.== For the first time at these redshifts, ==host galaxy starlight is detected around a luminous quasar.== ==A prominent Ly-alpha halo, detected with MUSE on the ESO/VLT,== partially overlaps the companion galaxy. ==The data in hand already show all the agents of rapid galaxy growth at play: gas, dust, star formation, and nuclear activity==. Here we propose to capitalize on the unprecedented capabilities of JWST to secure NIRSpec IFU observations, creating ==Halpha, Hbeta, [OIII] and [NII] maps== which will enable: 1) a characterization of the ==ionized gas physical properties== (metallicity, ionization parameter, powering mechanism) and a test for the ==presence of outflows;== 2) an estimate of the stellar mass of the ==satellite galaxy==; 3) a ==precise timing of the star formation event==, which we will use to understand the role of the gravitational interaction in triggering the starburst; 4) a test of the ==origin of the Ly-alpha halo==. These observations will lead to a fundamental new understanding of the build-up of massive galaxies and black holes in the early universe.%%选源：z=6的有HST/ALMA/ESO/VLT观测的正在merger satellite galaxies的quasar%%
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose to secure NIRSpec IFU observations of the ==quasar+galaxy merging system PJ308-21 at z=6.234.== Very recently, ==ALMA has provided first unambiguous evidence of satellite galaxies around quasars==. The targeted system is the poster child of merging galaxies at z>6: High angular resolution (~0.2" or ~1 kpc) observations of the ==rest-frame UV starlight emission (from HST) and of the [CII] and rest-frame FIR dust continuum (from ALMA)== reveal the interplay of gas, dust, star formation, and nuclear activity. We can explain the intricate morphology with a current dynamical model invoking the tidal stripping of one or more satellite galaxies orbiting in close proximity to the quasar host galaxy. In addition, a bright Ly-alpha halo extends on the Eastern side of the quasar host, partially overlapping the satellite galaxy.

The system can be covered in only ==two IFU pointings==. A third pointing off-source will be used for background subtraction. We will target ==key optical diagnostic emission lines: Halpha, Hbeta, [OIII], [NII]==, as well as the stellar optical continuum emission, all in a single spectral setup. The goals of the project include measuring the instantaneous star formation rate, reconstructing the kinematics of the ionized gas, constraining metallicity, ionization parameter, probing the origin of the Ly-alpha halo, measuring its metallicity and ionization parameter, and assessing the stellar mass budget of the system.

### ABSTRACT
JWST will be the most sensitive tool ever built for studying the accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies. While quasars and bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide spectacular examples of this accretion, a vast majority of galaxies have black holes accreting at much lower rates. ==Although these low luminosity AGN (LLAGN) are not as well studied or understood as their brighter counterparts==, it is clear their inner structures differ significantly from the accretion disks in luminous AGN. JWST spectroscopy provides a unique opportunity to significantly advance our understanding of LLAGN. Our proposal focuses on ==getting IFU spectra from 1.7 to 28 microns for seven of the nearest LLAGN spanning four orders of magnitude in both black hole mass and accretion rate== %%选源：最近的七个LLAGN，相差四个量级的黑洞质量和吸积率%%(these will also be complemented by two GTO targets). JWST's spatial resolution will enable easy ==separation of the AGN from the host galaxy light providing us with spectral templates of low luminosity AGN spectra in the infrared for the first time.== Detailed physical modeling of both the line emission and spectral energy distributions of these LLAGN spectra will reveal the physical structure of low luminosity AGN, and how it varies with the mass and accretion rate of the SMBH. We will also use these spectral templates to empirically determine the most sensitive lines and SED features for spectroscopically and photometrically ==identifying LLAGN in more distant galaxies where the AGN won't be spatially resolved.== ReveaLLAGN will both significantly enhance our understanding of AGN and open a new window for future AGN studies with JWST.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The primary goal of our proposal is to ==characterize the infrared SEDs and line emission of seven low luminosity AGN== and to use JWST’s superior sensitivity and spatial resolution to cleanly ==disentangle their nuclear spectra from the surrounding galaxy emission==. We request NIRSpec IFU observations in two gratings (G235H and G395H) and MIRI MRS observations in all three dichroic settings. ==Taken together, these data will provide high-quality “pure” AGN spectra over a wavelength range that is mostly inaccessible from the ground (from 1.7-28 microns)==

We request ==~900s exposures with both NIRSpec and MIRI to obtain S/N>30 spectra== of the AGN over the full wavelength range of the data based on measured broad band fluxes in K band and at 12 microns. We will use a ==standard four point dither== in all observations. In NIRSpec we will obtain LeakCals using single exposures in galaxies with fainter backgrounds, and using a full dither in the brightest three galaxies. For our MIRI observations, the variable background requires that we take offset sky exposures. These are taken in blank fields typically 5’ from the center of the galaxy selected based on WISE 12 micron imaging.

### ABSTRACT
The search for ==dual supermassive black holes== is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Following a merger of two galaxies, ==the two central supermassive black holes evolve into a bound binary and further inspiral until they eventually coalesce into a single merger product==. If black holes are actively accreting during the inspiral, ==such objects can be observed as a dual or binary quasar.== Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to search for such dual quasars at previously unreachable sub-kpc scales, based on the small motions of the light centroid as the two sources vary stochastically. ==We propose to study two kpc-scale dual quasars identified with this method and confirmed with follow-up observations at z=2-3==%%%选源：2个dual quasar用Gaia发现并经过后续认证，位于z=2-3，peak epoch%%, the peak epoch of galaxy formation. Dual quasars at this epoch are not well characterized, especially due limited wavelength coverage of key spectral features and stringent spatial resolution requirements. ==The unprecedented NIR sensitivity, spatial resolution, and spectral coverage of JWST will enable us to study the gas dynamics in dual quasars for the first time at these redshifts.== We propose to use the IFU capabilities of NIRSpec and MIRI to study the impact of these dual quasars on their hosts and to probe the quasar fueling mechanisms, host galaxy merger signatures, host stellar continuum, and merger induced star formation.

## GO 2701 Unveiling the Nature of CID-42. The Best Candidate for a Gravitational Wave Recoiling Supermassive Black Hole
**Principal Investigator:** Francisco Mueller-Sanchez

**Allocation:** 6.6 hours
Observing Template:NIRSpec/IFU
### TARGET
2XMM-J100043.1+020637
### ABSTRACT
COSMOS J100043.1+020637.2 (or CID-42) is a galaxy with ==exceptional properties==: ==**two optical nuclei separated by ~0.5", a long tidal tail, X-ray emission from only one optical source, and a broad H emission-line centered at 1300 km/s from the systemic velocity.**== These properties make CID-42 the best candidate ==gravitational wave (GW) recoiling supermassive black hole (SMBH) to date==, but other scenarios, such as an inspiraling active galactic nucleus (AGN) pair, accretion disk kinematics, or a gravitational slingshot recoil resulting from a triple-SMBH encounter cannot be excluded. With spatially resolved JWST NIRSpec integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopy, it is now possible to definitively ==determine whether this galaxy hosts a GW recoiling SMBH by mapping the 2D kinematics of the stars and the broad and narrow emission lines of ionized gas==. We will be able to determine in a straightforward way ==three main kinematic properties of GW recoiling SMBHs==: (i) the ==kinematically-offset broad emission lines== should be spatially coincident with the spatially-offset AGN, (ii) the ==kinematic center of the galaxy== should be spatially coincident with the central stellar cusp left behind by the recoiling SMBH, and (iii) ==the velocities of the narrow emission lines should be close to the systemic velocity of the galaxy== at all spatial positions in the field-of-view and not close to the kick velocity of the merged SMBH. The proposed observations will have a tremendous impact on our knowledge of SMBH mergers and the associated emission of GWs. In fact, with ==a small investment of ~5 hours, this experiment could confirm the existence of GWs from SMBH mergers.==
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
This proposal focuses on the ==most compelling recoiling supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidate in the Universe: COSMOS J100043.15+020637.20,== also known as CID-42. The two main properties of a gravitational wave (GW) recoiling SMBH have been observed in this galaxy: ==it exhibits an active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is spatially offset from the galaxy center, and it has velocity shifts >1000 km/s between broad and narrow lines.== Over the last 7 years, our group has observed this object with the most powerful current-generation telescopes, including the HST and the Keck telescopes, and we have found that they are inadequate for pinning down the nature of this galaxy. With spatially-resolved JWST NIRSpec integral-field unit (IFU) spectroscopy, it is now possible to definitively determine whether this galaxy hosts a GW recoiling SMBH.

We will observe the ==Pa$\alpha$ 1.87 $\mu$m emission line== to trace the spatial distribution and kinematics of the broad-line and narrow-line emission regions in CID-42. Since H$\alpha$ lies in the optical (even at the redshift of CID-42), ==Pa$\alpha$ is our best option (this line is the strongest recombination line of hydrogen in the near-IR, and therefore a good tracer of the ionized gas in galaxies).== We will also study the ==kinematics of the [Si VI] 1.96 $\mu$m and [He I] 2.05 $\mu$m emission lines== to constrain the properties of outflows of ionized gas. Finally, we will trace the rotational component of the galaxy and the kinematics of the tidal tails (which possibly shows signatures of inflows) by mapping the 2D kinematics of the molecular hydrogen (H$_2$) emission line at 2.12 $\mu$m. Given the redshift of our target, we will use the grating-filter combination G235H/F170LP. We will cover the nuclear region most efficiently with the 0.1" plate scale. The 3"x3" field-of-view available with this configuration will be oriented along a position angle of 0 degrees.

Since the $H-$band magnitude of this COSMOS galaxy is well known ($H\sim18.8$ in an aperture of 1 arcsec), integration times are based on a surface brightness of 18.8 mag arcsec−2 in H−band. The ETC indicates that a total exposure time of 17286 s (4.8 hours) with a 2-Point dither strategy and assuming a galxy spectrum similar to NGC 6240 is sufficient to reach a S/N of ∼5 at 2.1μm, and 15−25 at larger wavelengths - as required, given the typical depths of stellar absorption features, to measure stellar kinematics (Davies et al. 2007).
