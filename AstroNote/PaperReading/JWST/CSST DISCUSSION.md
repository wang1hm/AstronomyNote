### ABSTRACT 
Supermassive black holes, and the outflows they drive, are an established part of our understanding of galaxy evolution. **Indeed, cosmological models rely on outflows to ==reproduce the observed scaling relations==.** But the enormous range of outflow rates that are measured for AGN of the same luminosity, highlights a gaping hole in our understanding of **how outflows are launched and driven**. Our sample of **AGN at similar distances and with similar luminosities, but with outflow rates differing by two orders of magnitude** %%选取样本的特点：在相同光度、距离下，outflow rate相差达到两个量级，进而研究outflow rate%%, provides the ideal opportunity to fill this gap. We will exploit the rich suite of diagnostics at ==5-29um== with MIRI MRS integral field spectroscopy and the sensitivity and resolution of JWST. ==Our analysis is built on the three cornerstones of molecular gas, ionized gas, and dust - observed together at the same resolution over the same scales==, enabling us to build a holistic view of the central few hundred parsecs. From the spatially resolved kinematics we will construct geometrical models that provide a direct view of how gas is fed in from the circumnuclear disk through the obscuring torus and driven out in the outflow. We will **associate the PAHs and the hot dust continuum to each of these components to test new models of the torus**. And from the numerous line ratios, we will quantify the role of **AGN versus stellar photoionization** on the different structures. Piecing this together will enable us to ==highlight the physical processes that determine the prominence of the observed outflow==, leading to a major advance in our understanding of the key mechanisms at the root of AGN fuelling and feedback.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The aim of the observations is to use the MIRI MRS to obtain, for a small sample of AGN, ==spatially resolved distributions and kinematics of various key emission lines, as well as maps of the PAHS and dust==. The target AGN have been chosen to be of similar luminosity and distance, but to cover a wide range of measured outflow rate (reflecting the range of observed line profiles). The observations therefore will be either ==single pointings or small mosaics defined from existing data, designed to cover the circumnuclear disk and the outflow out to scales of at most few hundred parsecs==. The centre of the region of interest for each pointing/mosaic is the bright point source, which indicates the location of the AGN.

==All 3 wavelength settings of MRS will be used==, because the emission lines of interest (which include molecular gas, and both low and high excitation ionized gas) are spread throughout the full MIRI bandpass. All of these are needed in order to perform ==not just kinematic modelling==, but also to model ==the excitation of the molecular and ionized gas==. %%用全部三个波段看分子气体以及高低激发态电离气体%%

Typically, ==a 4-point dither pattern is used==. But for 1 object (NGC5506), the position angle scheduling constraints mean that it is more effective to define an ==8-point linear mosiac along a specific direction==, rather than have 2 dithered pointings.

The AGN are relatively luminous, and mid-infrared imaging shows that the central point source can be very bright. Because of this, and based on the known maxmimum central mid-infrared flux density, the detector set-up for each target has been defined to ==avoid saturation by limiting the number of groups in an integration==. And the ==full intgeration times have been set in order to detect faint extended line emission==, as need for the modelling. Each target can be observed in a single visit.

The necessary separate background observations have been set up with the same detector read-out strategy, and with a 2-point dither in order to ensure that the background frames are optimal.

We will obtain simultaneous imaging in 3 filters. During the MRS background exposures, the SUB256 imager field (this ensures we do not saturate the bright nucleus) is centered on the AGN, ==allowing us to map the continuum and silicate absorption out to larger scales than covered by the MRS.==

**Allocation:** 6.1 hours

### TARGET
##### IC 5063
### ABSTRACT
We propose MIRI MRS observations of the ==nearby galaxy IC5063== that will enable us to determine the changes in the ==H2 gas properties== that occur as ==radio jets propagate through a disk and initiate outflows==. We will map the emission of H2 lines in order to derive ==the temperature, the density, and thus the pressure== of the warm and tenuous medium surrounding the ==cold and dense molecular clouds impacted by the jets==. By comparing this pressure map with ==a pressure map from CO(1-0) to (4-3) ALMA data==, we will quantify the changes in the ==external vs. internal pressure== and, thus, in the stability of individual dense clouds after the jet passage. **==We will observationally determine, for the first time, the mass fraction of dense clouds that joins the outflow==**. We will examine whether the dissipation of the dense clouds that leads to their entrainment is primarily due to ==shocks, cosmic rays, or X-rays==. From the density and the velocity of the warm H2, we will obtain ==a lower limit for the outflow duration based on how long ram pressure took to accelerate dense clouds to the observed velocities==. From the mass and the velocity of the warm H2, we will compute the total molecular gas mass that resulted in the halo and got removed from the reservoir available for star formation. Combining gas and dust diagnostics, we will look for star formation variations along the jet. For this project, which will test fundamental physics models of the dense gas acceleration in million or billion solar mass outflows, we ask for ==~2 hours of science time on the JWST==. The observations will have a highly demonstrative value for the telescope, as IC5063 is a well studied galaxy, prototype of jet-driven winds.

### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose for JWST MIRI MRS observations of the local galaxy IC5063, in which ==a radio jet impacts dense molecular clouds as it propagates through the disk.== Outflows are initiated along its propagation path. Our goal is to obtain ==**spatially-resolved information o
n the warm molecular gas properties, such as its density, temperature, and mass**==. This information will enable us to determine the conditions of ==the warm ISM surrounding the dense molecular clouds that are impacted by the radio jet==, and to examine how the pressure of the ==external H2-emitting medium affects the stability of the CO-emitting dense clouds==. The amount of gas originating from dissipated dense clouds and the fraction of the overall warm H2 medium that is lost to the halo and removed from the star formation reservoir will be computed. ==A mosaic is requested comprising both the jet trail and quiescent regions around it, so that spatial gradients between the jet-affected and unaffected regions are quantified==. The mosaic needs to have a position angle between 57 -92 or 237-272 degrees. Sky observations should be executed in an interrupted sequence with the source observations.




## GO 2177 A missing piece of the puzzle: the warm molecular phase of AGN-driven outflows at cosmic noon

### ABSTRACT
An efficient coupling between the energy released by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) and the interstellar medium (ISM) of their ==host galaxy can generate kpc scales outflows== which may regulate the rate at ==which stars can form and ultimately influence the growth of the galaxy.== These AGN-driven outflows include gas in various phases ==(ionized, atomic, molecular) but at z>1,== due to the limitations of current instrumentation, ==we are forced to adopt a single-phase (ionized) view== of the outflow phenomenon which may lead to wrong estimates of their extent, mass and energetics, therefore ultimately misinterpreting their relevance for galaxy evolution.%%此前只能假定ionized phase，用JWST可以同时考虑ionized，atomic，molecular态%%

The aim of the proposed JWST/MIRI observations is to overcome this limit, and to ==map the mid-infrared ro-vibrational H2 lines to complete the multi-phase characterization== %%多波段观测%%of already well-studied AGN at cosmic noon. ==The three selected AGN have the best available characterization of the ionized component of the outflow at these redshifts==, ==from sub-pc to kpc scales==. With the MIRI observations we will be able to map the warm component of the ISM down to ~2 kpc. We will be able to test model predictions on the enhancement of H2 emission in the presence of cooling of gas shocked by AGN-driven outflow. Ultimately, ==we will derive the total (ionized+molecular) mass outflow rate and kinetic energy== for these outflows which will provide a key constrain on the current models of AGN feedback.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The targets of these observations are three AGN at z~2 with well established ionized outflows from sub-pc to kpc scales.  
We will use ==MIRI MRS to sample the warm molecular phase== of the outflow via H2 transitions with the Long configuration in CH-1  
We will also cover the ==PAH3.3 micron feature in the Long configuration in CH-2==  
We will not perform Targer Acquisition, since the absolute JWST pointing accuracy of 0.1 arcsec is more than sufficient given the size of our targets (~1 arcsec diameter) and the fov of CH-1.

**Allocation:** 9.0 hours
Observing Template: MIRI Medium Resolution Spectroscopy + NIRSpec IFU Spectroscopy
### TARGET
PDS456
### ABSTRACT
Quasar outflows are among the leading internal ==negative-feedback processes to explain the inside-out quenching of star formation== in massive galaxies and the tight SMBH-spheroid mass relation. The likely culprits, ==the fast-accreting quasars==, ==are common at the epoch of peak SMBH accretion but rare locally==, making it hard to catch and study this negative-feedback phenomenon in action, even with JWST. Fortunately, there is one spectacular exception: PDS 456, ==the most luminous quasar in the local universe==. ==Clear unambiguous signatures of outflows== have been detected in this object on all scales, ranging from the X-ray/UV-detected relativistic wind on sub-pc accretion-disk scales to the galaxy-wide warm-ionized and cold-molecular outflows which extend to at least 10 kpc. The energetics of the outflow indicate that it is potentially able to rapidly quench star formation in the host although the current observations are still missing the critically important ==coronal-ionized, neutral-atomic, and warm-molecular gas phases== to determine if the quasar actually affects the host evolution. The proposed NIRSpec and MIRI data cubes, analyzed with the highly optimized PSF decomposition software package IFSFIT, will allow us to ==(1) get an accurate and complete census of the outflow energetics, (2) constrain the dominant mechanisms that drive this outflow and AGN duty cycle, and (3) characterize the impact of the quasar outflow== and intense radiation field on the physical state of the host ISM, coeval star formation activity, and circumgalactic medium. These exquisite data will serve as a local template to help interpret the coarser data from scheduled GTO/ERS JWST studies of distant quasars.
### OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION

--> total exposure time on source: 75 min  
1 leakage exposure at one dither position: 11 min

-MIRI IFU with the SHORT, MEDIUM, and LONG wavelength settings  
data acquisition starts on the quasar itself (with FND filter), before a shift 0.5" S to capture blobs A and B 4-point all-wavelength extended source dither pattern  
40 groups and 5 integrations per dither position for each wavelength setting  
Readout mode: FAST  
--> total exposure time on source: 3 x 37 min = 111 min

### ABSTRACT
When galactic outflows are triggered, what is the ==impact of feedback on the interstellar medium at the launch site==? How much ==energy== is transported into the ==circumnuclear regions== and subsequently affect the ==dust geometry== and ==metal distribution==? What drives these winds and how do they depend on ==intrinsic AGN propertie==s or ==nuclear star formation rates==? Addressing these pressing questions will have a profound impact on our understanding of the role of feedback in galaxy evolution, and can only be answered observationally using ==high spatial- and spectral-resolution infrared instruments== -- capable of peering through heavy dust screens into galactic nuclei where powerful outflows are launched -- finally made available with JWST.

Capitalizing on the unparalleled diagnostic capability MIRI exhibits over the full 5-28 micron range, our proposed MRS observations of ==7 nearby luminous infrared galaxies== known to ==host prominent shocked molecular outflows== will provide a holistic view of the ==molecular gas, dust, AGN, star formation, and metallicity== in the central 4 kpc of ongoing galaxy mergers at the scales of 30-90 pc. We will determine the heating mechanisms for and gauge energetics of the outflows, correlate their spatial properties with AGN strength, and map their influence on metal distribution and star formation in different environments spanning a range of bolometric AGN fraction, infrared luminosities, and merger class. The 4x better spectral resolution of MRS over Spitzer IRS carries discovery potential in mapping the ionization state of the outflows.%%已知的7个较近的有molecular outflow的源%%

Proprietary data rights are waived to enhance the data's legacy value and to facilitate Cycle 2 proposals for the community.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose MIRI MRS observations for 7 sources in our sample of ==(U)LIRGs==. Two of these sources will be observed as part of a GTO (IRAS F17207-0014; ID 1204, PI Rieke; covering only the short (A) sub-band within MRS) or an ERS (NGC 7469; ID 1328, PI Armus;covering all MIRI modes with sufficient exposure depth for our science goals) program, so we are ==proposing full 528m MIRI MRS observations for the remaining targets==. We will fully utilize the wavelength range of four MRS channels for the suite of ==diagnostic lines== accessible within 5-28m.

We will adopt the ==4-point dither== pattern optimized for an extended source for better sampling of the PSF with relatively uniform coverage. Since our targets span the ==FOV==, we request an off-target observation with a 2-point dither pattern to reduce overheads while providing proper background subtraction for each source. The Background pointing and the Science observation are linked in an uninterruptible sequence for this purpose. ==Simultaneous MIRI imaging of another part of the host galaxy will be obtained in F560W, F770W, and F1500W band==s, useful for improving astrometry and facilitating other ancillary science goals (i.e. mapping PAH features at F770W and dust temperature distribution using F560W and F1500W).

**Allocation:** 4.2 hours

### TARGET
ESO 420-G13
### ABSTRACT
We propose JWST/MIRI medium resolution spectroscopic observations of the ==multi-phase outflow== in ESO 420-G13 to obtain: i) ==the mass and the energy== budget for both the ==ionized and the molecular wind== components; ii) the first ==IR-based determination of the chemical abundances== and the ==metal-loading factor== in a AGN-driven outflow. The mass and the energy budget will then be compared with current AGN feedback simulations, to determine ==the role of the ionized wind in the acceleration and dispersion of the molecular gas and the origin of the outflowing material.== IR-based metallicities in the outflow of ESO 420-G13 can provide the first direct evidence of whether AGN-driven outflows ==regulate the content of heavy elements in galaxies.== Chemical abundances based on IR transitions are insensitive to the dust obscuration and the temperature effects that introduce serious biases in ==stratified and inhomogeneous nebulae==, conditions that are expected when a strong galactic wind is present. This study will provide unique insight into the feedback processes in ==low-luminosity AGN==, the most common form of activity in the nearby Universe. ESO 420-G13 represents ==one of the two cases where a radio-elusive jet has been revealed through its interaction with the ISM==, and the only one where ==the ionized phase of the outflow has been revealed in the [NeII] 12.8 micron emission line==, distinguishing this source as an ideal laboratory to study the supermassive black hole-ISM interaction with JWST.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose JWST/MIRI MRS observations of the ==ionized and molecular gas outflow in the low-luminosity AGN ESO 420-G13==, to derive the mass and the energy budget for both components and provide the first IR-based measurement of the ==chemical abundances== and the ==metal-loading factor== in an AGN-driven wind. ==Our main goal is to characterize the AGN feedback mechanism, determine the origin of the outflowing material, and probe whether AGN-driven outflows are able to regulate the content of heavy elements in galaxies.== Mosaic observations of the central 6"x6" (1.5 x 1.5 kpc2) using a 4-point dither pattern are proposed for the three dichroic settings, to cover the bridge between the inner ionized outflow detected in the [NeII] 12.8 micron line with VLT/VISIR and the cold molecular ==gas outflow detected in CO(2-1)== with ALMA. A dedicated sky acquisition is included to subtract the background contribution, to be executed next to the science acquisition. No other special requirements are requested. The total exposure time is 45 min., corresponding to a total observing time of 4.0 hours including the overheads.

### TARGET
Group TNJ1338-1942-GRP
TGSSJ1530+1049
### ABSTRACT
The evolution in the mass accretion rate and density of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) shows that the ==SMBHs in today's most massive galaxies formed in a relatively short time after the Big Bang.== This biased growth of massive galaxies and SMBHs requires ==rapid accretion in the early Universe==, coupled with a ==strong influence of SMBH activity on the hosts== through powerful radio jets and radiation-driven winds. Luminous radio galaxies offer ideal laboratories for studying both modes of AGN ‘feedback’ and where the ==AGN does not outshine its host galaxy== (unlike for quasars). With the NIRSpec/IFU it is now possible for the first time to ==spatially resolve the impact of AGN radio jets on their host galaxies in the rest-frame optical at z > 4.==

We will target ==the rest-frame optical emission of two of the most distant, prototypical radio galaxies==, TN J1338- 1942 (z=4.11) and TGSS J1530+1049 (z=5.72). We will spatially ==resolve the ionization state, kinematics and metallicity== of the gas to constrain how AGN with large-scale radio jets inject energy and modify star-formation in the presence of infall and ==AGN- and starburst-driven winds==. The data will also constrain the ==stellar populations, delineate the host galaxy morphologies, and detect broad emission lines in scattered light== to derive black hole masses. Both objects will be observed with ==NIRCam in GTO to study their larger Mpc-scale environments==. Together these programs will allow us to derive a complete picture of the evolution of some of the most massive and powerful radio AGN known in the early universe, from their energetic cores to their wider cosmic environments.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
==NIRspec/IFU observations of two high redshift targets.== Target TNJ1338-1942 will be observed with ==two dispersers (G235H and G395H)== and by nodding off the source for background subtraction. Target TGSS J1530+1049 will be observed with ==one disperser (G395H)== and by nodding on the source.

We use the readout pattern NRSIRS2 with 16 groups per integration, 2 integrations and ==4 dither points== for the target group TN J1338-1942-GRP which includes the target and the nod off-scene background pointing. We use the readout pattern NRSIRS2 with 19 groups per integration, 5 integrations and 4 dithers for the target TGSS J1530+1049, which will have nod in-scene background subtraction using the 4-point nod.

We do not require target acquisition as TN J1338-1942 has available deep HST as well as ==high-resolution radio imagin==g, and TGSS J1530+1049 has Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) radio imaging available with sub-arcsecond resolution.%%不需要很高的射电波段光谱数据，已经有HST和VLBI的数据了，主要是补齐NIR的光谱%%

### ABSTRACT
Actively accreting supermassive black holes (AGN) can have ==significant impact on the evolution of their host galaxies through feedback== in the form of gas winds and radio jets which can be seen on ==kpc scale,== encompassing the entire galaxy. We propose here to determine the impact of ==powerful AGN on their host galaxies at Cosmic Noo==n where the co-moving density of luminous AGN is at its peak. Our sample consists of high-redshift radio galaxies (HzRGs), the only AGN population, in which ==quasar-mode feedback, radio-mode feedback and the host galaxies can be characterised simultaneously.== We will use the JWST to 'zoom into' some of the most massive and active galaxies at the onset of the peak of star-formation and AGN activity to address the long-standing question on ==how exactly AGN-driven outflows propagate into the host galaxy and how small-scale phenomena close to the central engine reflect on the large-scale jet and gas characteristics==. The diffraction-limited resolution of JWST and two-dimensional coverage with NIRSpec IFU will provide a ==10-fold improvement in resolution over existing observations and will allow us to map the stellar, gas, and excitation components of distant HzRGs== all at once for the first time. It is critically important to compare ==local AGN with what happens near the start of the peak of the cosmic star formation rate density== at comparable sub-kpc scale resolution, and with exactly the same diagnostics. Our sample at the “sweet spot” redshift ==~3.5== is uniquely suited to do this, covering the critical wavelength regime between ==[OII] and H-alpha even including [SII]== in just one spectral setting with the NIRSpec G235H/F170LP.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will be observing four high-redshift radio galaxies at z ~ 3.5 using the NIRSpec IFUs. The main goal is to ==spatially map the emission lines from [OII] to H-alpha and [SII]== that are all covered in just ==one spectral setting (G235H/170LP)==.

### ABSTRACT
Understanding the ouflows driven by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) is of key importance for the modern view of galaxy evolution. A recent paradigm shift in our picture of ==dust in the vicinity of AGN== offers promise for outflow science. We now know that a major part of an AGN's mid- infrared ==(MIR) dust emission== comes from a ==polar structure that arises in a radiatively-accelerated dusty wind==. Ground-based work has shown that similar polar emission is also found hundreds of pc away from the nucleus. ==If we can confirm that this extended polar emission is fundamentally connected to the pc-scale dusty wind, it will be our best evidence yet for a coherent dynamical connection between nuclear and galaxy-scale outflows.==

This proposal will employ MIRI multi-filter imaging to unravel the nature of AGN-heated emission beyond the central ==100 parsec==. It relies on the unparalleled surface-brightness sensitivity of JWST, a strength that the best ground-based instruments cannot match. Our 8 targets are ==well-studied nearby Seyferts that already have established polar dust detections==, and are carefully selected for their ==high-resolution ancillary data== (HST imaging, AO-assisted and ALMA 3D spectroscopy).%%为了看AGN周围polar dust emission和百pc范围的dust是不是在根本上一样，进而证明AGN feedback影响星系，选源是已经有well polar dust detection，有HST等辅助数据%%

The new JWST data will reveal the structure and colors of the extended dust. We will compare the geometry of the dust to the predictions of hydrodynamic simulations, determine its masses and energy content using ==state-of-the-art radiative transfer models,== and explore its grain composition using novel diagnostics of broad-band spectral features. Along with ancillary kinematic information, we will test the salient hypothesis that ==the extended dust emission is shaped by a nuclear outflow.==
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
The proposed observations consist of MIRI imager exposures in multiple bands over the central regions of ==eight (8) nearby Seyfert galaxies==. The targets are bright extended galaxies and all have bright point sources that account for most of their central mid-infrared flux.

Our science goals investigate the nature of the ==low surface-brightness extended warm dust emission.==  
We require 5 filterbands (F560W, F1000W, F1500W, F1800W, F2100W) for a detailed study of ==resolved spectral energy distributions, temperature modelling, and dust mass estimation.==

==We adopt a strategy of short ramps (Ngroup = 5) and many integrations (Nint = 50) to minimise saturation of the central point source, while obtaining sufficiently deep exposures sensitive to the extended emission.== %%？为什么这样就能避免%%We will use the SUB256 imaging subarray, which has a suitable field of view for our goals coupled with a FAST readout mode.

Our science pointings are centered on our targets and take a 4-point dither strategy optimised for point-sources to allow for background estimation, the treatment of detector flatfields, and central point source modelling and subtraction. In order to accurately remove the thermal backgrounds which will affect the three long wavelength bands, we will also take exposures of a nearby background field for all our targets, with an identical readout configuration and a 2-point dither to remove source structure in the field.
## GO 2547 Quasar Feedback in Action: The Multiphase and Multiscale Outflow of the Most Luminous Quasar in the Local Universe \[also in former part (outflow)]
**Principal Investigator:** Sylvain Veilleux
**PI Institution:**  University of Maryland
**Allocation:** 9.0 hours
Observing Template: MIRI/MRS  
NIRSpec/IFU
### TARGET
PDS456
### ABSTRACT
Quasar outflows are among the leading internal ==negative-feedback processes to explain the inside-out quenching of star formation== in massive galaxies and the tight SMBH-spheroid mass relation. The likely culprits, ==the fast-accreting quasars==, ==are common at the epoch of peak SMBH accretion but rare locally==, making it hard to catch and study this negative-feedback phenomenon in action, even with JWST. Fortunately, there is one spectacular exception: PDS 456, ==the most luminous quasar in the local universe==. ==Clear unambiguous signatures of outflows== have been detected in this object on all scales, ranging from the X-ray/UV-detected relativistic wind on sub-pc accretion-disk scales to the galaxy-wide warm-ionized and cold-molecular outflows which extend to at least 10 kpc. The energetics of the outflow indicate that it is potentially able to rapidly quench star formation in the host although the current observations are still missing the critically important ==coronal-ionized, neutral-atomic, and warm-molecular gas phases== to determine if the quasar actually affects the host evolution. The proposed NIRSpec and MIRI data cubes, analyzed with the highly optimized PSF decomposition software package IFSFIT, will allow us to ==(1) get an accurate and complete census of the outflow energetics, (2) constrain the dominant mechanisms that drive this outflow and AGN duty cycle, and (3) characterize the impact of the quasar outflow== and intense radiation field on the physical state of the host ISM, coeval star formation activity, and circumgalactic medium. These exquisite data will serve as a local template to help interpret the coarser data from scheduled GTO/ERS JWST studies of distant quasars.
### OBSERVATION DESCRIPTION
We will observe PDS 456 using the NIRSpec and MIRI IFUs with the following settings:

-NIRSpec IFU with G235H/F170LP  
data acquisition starts on the quasar itself, before a shift 0.5" S to capture blobs A and B 4-point dither pattern  
20 groups and 5 integrations per dither position  
Readout mode: NRSRAPID  
--> total exposure time on source: 75 min  
1 leakage exposure at one dither position: 11 min

-MIRI IFU with the SHORT, MEDIUM, and LONG wavelength settings  
data acquisition starts on the quasar itself (with FND filter), before a shift 0.5" S to capture blobs A and B 4-point all-wavelength extended source dither pattern  
40 groups and 5 integrations per dither position for each wavelength setting  
Readout mode: FAST  
--> total exposure time on source: 3 x 37 min = 111 min  
One background image in F1130W interspaced between each spectral setting  
--> exposure time for interspacde F1130W images: 3 x 0.9 min ~ 3 min  
1 off-source background data cube (obtained immediately after the on-source cube using the same settings as the on-source data cube) --> total exposure time on background: 3 x 37 min = 111 min  
--> exposure time for interspaced F1130W images: 3 x 0.9 mn ~ 3 min

Observing Template: 
### TARGET
NGC 4151
### ABSTRACT
The discovery of a number of black hole (BH) galaxy relations has shown that ==the growth of supermassive BHs is closely related to the evolution of galaxies.== This evidence has opened a new debate in which the fundamental questions concern the interactions between the central BH and the interstellar medium within the host galaxy, and can be addressed by studying two crucial processes: ==feeding and feedback==. Using archival JWST NIRSpec data, we aim to characterize the circumnuclear region of NGC 4151 to study, with unprecedented detail AGN feeding and feedback. NGC 4151, as one of the nearest AGN and an extremely well-studied Seyfert galaxy, provides an outstanding opportunity to obtain meaningful constraints for models incorporating these processes to regulate ==BH-host galaxy co-evolution==. We will achieve this by: (1) tracing outflows via ionized and coronal gas emission to establish the energetics of the outflowing gas and potential for feedback into the host galaxy, (2) tracing inflows via molecular hydrogen gas emission from which the driving inflow mechanism can be identified and an inflow rate obtained via modeling, (3) using the wide range of available H2 lines in the near-IR to establish their connection with the obscuring torus, and (4) obtaining a molecular gas-based black hole mass estimate. JWST is uniquely capable of advancing our understanding of these processes due to its sensitivity and stable point-spread-function, which facilitates the detection of diagnostic emission lines not available in current ground based data, as well as probing these processes down to unprecedented spatial scales.

### ABSTRACT
We propose to observe ==two z~6 quasars== with NIRCam to prove the detectability of their host galaxies. High-z quasars outshine their hosts at ==rest frame UV/optical wavelengths==. ==Observing the underlying host galaxy emission has eluded HST, even with advanced PSF-modelling techniques.== However, detailed simulations predict that the improved resolution of JWST/NIRCam will result in successful detections of these host galaxies for the first time, with our observational strategy predicted to ==yield optimal detections==. The two quasars selected for this pilot program were ==comprehensively studied with HST and ALMA==, and are expected to have ==relatively low contrast between the quasar and host, improving detectability.== %%选的是已经有HST和ALMA观测的源，且quasar和host的contrast较小，探测更好%%The proposed pilot program will demonstrate the capability of JWST to observe high-z quasar host galaxies, and provide valuable insight into the growth of black holes and galaxies in the early Universe, and of the relationships between black holes and their host galaxies.

With these NIRCam data we will:  
(a) ==Characterize the rest frame UV/optical SEDs of these quasar host galaxies==, determining their star formation histories and dust content  
(b) Determine the stellar mass of the hosts, allowing us to ==measure the black hole–stellar mass ratio for high-z quasars for the first time==  
(c) Compare the ==stellar (JWST) and gas (ALMA) properties== of the galaxies such as their star formation rates, sizes, morphologies and masses, to see the full picture of these host galaxies  
(d) Study the ==environments of these high-z quasars==, photometrically identifying and characterizing any potential companion galaxies.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose to obtain NIRCam photometry of the two quasars SDSS J0129-0035 at z=5.78 and SDSS J2054-0005 at z=6.04, with the aim of detecting and characterising their host galaxies. We will use the ==F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W and F444W filters==, with exposure times of ==7.5 ks 
for the short-wavelength filters and 5 ks for the long-wavelength filters==. %%为什么长波短波曝光时间不一样？%%These will be observed with the ==8-point small-grid dither pattern for accurate sub-pixel sampling of the PSF.==

Alongside these quasar observations, we will ==observe two stars to accurately characterize the instrument PSF,== to be used for detailed point-source modelling of the quasar to detect the underlying host galaxy. These PSF stars SDSS J0132-0002 and SDSS J2130+0028 are chosen as they are ==M-type stars with colors very similar to those of the quasars, so as to minimize chromatic PSF errors==. They are faint enough to be detected with the NIRCam full array, are close to the quasars on the sky, and are single stars with no nearby contaminating objects. These PSF stars will be observed directly after the quasar observations, and at the same position angle and similar position on the detector, to minimize any temporal or spatial variation in the PSF so that the quasar PSF is modelled as accurately as possible.

### ABSTRACT
We propose NIRSpec Fixed-Slit + NIRCam broad-band observations of ==12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars known at z=6 to obtain the first full census of the black holes and host galaxies of the earliest quasars.== We will derive the ==well-calibrated Hbeta-based masses (M_BH)== of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with NIRSpec's G395M grism, from which we ==characterize the distribution functions of M_BH and Eddington ratios==, eliminating severe previous selection biases due to the limitation of ground-based NIR spectroscopy. We will measure their ==host stellar masses== with NIRCam's F150W and F356W filters to calculate the ==SMBH-to-stellar mass ratios==, from which we investigate the origin of the tight correlation between M_BH and host bulge mass observed ==in the present-day universe==. ==Our sample size will allow us to stringently determine whether SMBHs have grown in parallel with their hosts== (as suggested by recent ALMA observations), or ==if one evolves faster than the other==. Our sample is the least biased of all high-z quasar samples, allowing us to derive a comprehensive picture of the SMBHs and their host galaxies within the first billion years of the universe.%%选高红移目前已知最弱的源以避免bias，进而看早期SMBH-to-stellar mass ratio和现在的宇宙有没有区别，和ALMA对比%%
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
This program is a joint NIRSpec Fixed-Slit Spectroscopy and NIRCam imaging of 12 of the lowest-luminosity quasars known at z=6, beyond the sensitivity limits of ground-based near-infrared spectroscopy (y=23-24 AB mag). The NIRSpec observations with the G395M grism are designed to cover the redshifted ==Hbeta emission line at 3.44-3.60 micro==n and its underlying continua, from which robust virial masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) will be measured with the single-epoch method. The NIRCam imaging with F150W and F356W filters straddling the 4000 Angstrom breaks will enable us to measure the ==stellar masses and stellar populations of the host galaxies==, after carefully subtracting the PSF components in the broad-band images. The 2D PSF+galaxy decomposition will give us an ==estimate of the stellar light contamination to the observed continuum fluxes== in the NIRSpec spectrum covering the same wavelength range. ==Thanks to the low luminosities of our sample, the black hole masses and stellar properties of the host galaxies will constrain the mass distribution function and the stellar-to-SMBH mass ratios of the z=6 quasars for the first time.==%%？为什么low luminosities就可以限制质量分布函数以及stellar-to-SMBH mass ratios了%%

### ABSTRACT
AGN have become key components of most galaxy evolution models, yet several open issues remain in our understanding of ==how the link between galaxies and their SMBHs is established and maintained==. We propose to survey the host demographics of AGN during the ==first quarter of cosmic tim==e in order to understand ==when and how the AGN-galaxy connection is established.== Our study will use data from the ==CEERS ERS program==, whose NIRCam, MIRI and NIRSpec observations will enable a wide range of AGN-related science. We will use ==a combination of X-ray data and CEERS MIRI and NIRSpec data to create a multiwavelength sample of AGN== and use it to conduct the following science: (1) ==NIRCam imaging will provide rest-frame optical morphologies of AGN hosts at z=2-6.== We will trace the emergence of bulge and disk structures and their connection to SMBH growth during the era of galaxy assembly and determine the role that ==galaxy mergers play in fueling AGN activity== during this epoch. (2) We will use ==MIRI color diagnostics== to perform a census of obscured SMBHs out to z=2, revealing the properties of this previously ==hidden population and determining how the fraction of obscured AGN evolves with redshift.== (3) We will use NIRSpec data to conduct a survey of ==AGN-driven outflows== at z>3 and measure the impact they have on their host galaxies. (4) We will search for the ==seeds== of today's SMBHs at Cosmic Dawn by using NIRSpec to find high ionization lines from growing SMBHs at z>7. As part of our science analysis, we will ==release value-added catalogs of morphologies, emission line fluxes, and AGN identifications to supplement the CEERS dataset and directly enable future community use of JWST.==

Group PJ308-21
### ABSTRACT
At ==z>6== (when the Universe is <1 Gyr old), ==luminous quasars are exceptionally active: their central engine is a rapidly accreting supermassive== (~1e9 Msun) black hole which resides in an intensely star-forming galaxy that is ab order of magnitude more massive than typical galaxies at these redshifts. How can we account for such a ==rapid growth== of these extreme sources? The exceptional quasar PJ308-21 may offer an answer. ==High-resolution HST and ALMA imaging demonstrates that the quasar host is undergoing a merger with one or more satellite galaxies.== For the first time at these redshifts, ==host galaxy starlight is detected around a luminous quasar.== ==A prominent Ly-alpha halo, detected with MUSE on the ESO/VLT,== partially overlaps the companion galaxy. ==The data in hand already show all the agents of rapid galaxy growth at play: gas, dust, star formation, and nuclear activity==. Here we propose to capitalize on the unprecedented capabilities of JWST to secure NIRSpec IFU observations, creating ==Halpha, Hbeta, [OIII] and [NII] maps== which will enable: 1) a characterization of the ==ionized gas physical properties== (metallicity, ionization parameter, powering mechanism) and a test for the ==presence of outflows;== 2) an estimate of the stellar mass of the ==satellite galaxy==; 3) a ==precise timing of the star formation event==, which we will use to understand the role of the gravitational interaction in triggering the starburst; 4) a test of the ==origin of the Ly-alpha halo==. These observations will lead to a fundamental new understanding of the build-up of massive galaxies and black holes in the early universe.%%选源：z=6的有HST/ALMA/ESO/VLT观测的正在merger satellite galaxies的quasar%%
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We propose to secure NIRSpec IFU observations of the ==quasar+galaxy merging system PJ308-21 at z=6.234.== Very recently, ==ALMA has provided first unambiguous evidence of satellite galaxies around quasars==. The targeted system is the poster child of merging galaxies at z>6: High angular resolution (~0.2" or ~1 kpc) observations of the ==rest-frame UV starlight emission (from HST) and of the [CII] and rest-frame FIR dust continuum (from ALMA)== reveal the interplay of gas, dust, star formation, and nuclear activity. We can explain the intricate morphology with a current dynamical model invoking the tidal stripping of one or more satellite galaxies orbiting in close proximity to the quasar host galaxy. In addition, a bright Ly-alpha halo extends on the Eastern side of the quasar host, partially overlapping the satellite galaxy.

The system can be covered in only ==two IFU pointings==. A third pointing off-source will be used for background subtraction. We will target ==key optical diagnostic emission lines: Halpha, Hbeta, [OIII], [NII]==, as well as the stellar optical continuum emission, all in a single spectral setup. The goals of the project include measuring the instantaneous star formation rate, reconstructing the kinematics of the ionized gas, constraining metallicity, ionization parameter, probing the origin of the Ly-alpha halo, measuring its metallicity and ionization parameter, and assessing the stellar mass budget of the system.

### ABSTRACT
We propose to obtain high-resolution NIRspec fixed slits (FS) spectroscopy and MIRI low-resolution slit spectroscopy (LRS) for newly discovered ==infrared-dropout X-ray sources== (i.e., without any optical/NIR counterparts) in the COSMOS field. This is ==possibly the first population of accreting black holes==, and/or heavily obscured AGNs at high redshift, providing a valuable observational constraint on a hidden phase of a significant growth of supermassive black hole (SMBH) in the early universe. Considering that our targets are optically dark, the JWST spectroscopy is the only instrument allowing to obtain the ==high-resolution IR spectra to detect the emission lines to confirm the spectroscopic redshift and classification for these sources.== This proposed study will allow us to explore the most energetic and obscured phase of accreting black holes to understand the formation of SMBHs. Our program will facilitate the first detailed study of yet unknown heavily obscured population at early cosmic epoch.
### OBSERVING DESCRIPTION
We will use NIRspec FS high-resolution spectroscopy for 7 objects with robust Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 and 4.5um detections to identify the nature of these sources, whether they are really direct collapse black holes (DCBHs) or a yet undiscovered population of heavily obscured black holes at high redshift. Our primary goal is to detect emission lines in order to obtain the spectroscopic redshift, as well as some other features, e.g., broad-lines and/or outflows. We will use the grating/filter combination of G395M/F290LP with FULL/NRSIRS2RAPID. By using the dual slit dither (S200A1 and S200A2), we will obtain complete wavelength coverage from 2.87um to 5.14um in high-resolution R~2700. We will also use MIRI LRS slit spectroscopy for 3 objects, which are detected in all Spitzer/IRAC and MIPS24um bands, to measure their MIR spectra with significant S/N, covering 5-12um wavelength ranges with R~100.
