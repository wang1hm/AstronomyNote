# Gas Accretion onto the Milky Way
##  Historical Remarks
“high-velocity clouds” (HVCs) >100km/s
“intermediate-velocity clouds” (IVCs). 30-100km/s
 “low-velocity clouds” (LVCs)

 **the origin of the 21 cm neutral halo clouds** Jan Oort(1966):  the infall of intergalactic gas, the accretion of gas from satellite galaxies, the condensation of neutral gas patches from cooling coronal gas, and the ejection of gaseous material from the Milky Way disk 

**feeding the Milky Way disk with low-metallicity gas**-> gas-consumption timescale (even for a moderate star-formation rate of 1 $M_{\odot}/yr$) is short compared to the age of the Milky Way + metallicity distribution of low-mass stars in the solar neighborhood

=> the observed presence of large amounts of gas above/below the disk, star-formation rate, the metallicity distribution of low-mass stars has strong implications for the past, present, and future evolution of our Galaxy.

## Cosmological Context
**The hot mode:**  the gas then cools and sinks into the center of the potential where it is transformed into stars
**The cold mode:** the infalling gas may reach the disk directly at much shorter timescales, without being shock-heated to the virial temperature
 
 the dominating gas-accretion mode depends on the mass and the redshift of the galaxy ->  at low redshift the critical halo mass $10^{12} M_{\odot}$
 
Next to the feeding of the halos of Milky Way-type galaxies through intergalactic gas, galactic-fountain type processes and mergers with satellite galaxies need to be considered.

The vast amounts of neutral and ionized gas carried by **the Magellanic Stream** underline the importance of merger processes for the Milky Way’s gas-accretion rate

For the Milky Way, this implies that it has accreted a gas mass of $4\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ during the last 8 Gyr.

##  Parameterization of Gas Accretion
halo and disk

1. define the overall current-day gas-accretion rate of the Milky Way
    $$\frac{\mathrm{d} M_{\text {gas,halo }}}{\mathrm{d} t}=\frac{M_{\mathrm{gas}} v_{\text {infall }}}{d}$$
3.  The future disk gas-accretion rate
    $$\frac{\mathrm{d} M_{\mathrm{gas}, \mathrm{disk}}}{\mathrm{d} t}=\eta \frac{\mathrm{d} M_{\mathrm{gas}, \text { halo }}}{\mathrm{d} t}$$

## The Observed Distribution of Gas Around the Milky Way
### Neutral gas
#### IVC 
 Direct distance measurements -> Most of the IVCs thus belong to the disk-halo interface
 Absorption-line measurements -> extragalactic + dust + molecule 

the favored scenario for the origin of near solar- metallicity IVCs is that these structures represent the back-flow of cooled gas from the galactic-fountain process
#### HVC
Complex C + MS
the Magellanic Bridge, the total H I budget in the Milky Way halo sums up to a value of 20% of the neutral gas mass in the Milky Way disk
#### Warm Ionized Gas
 predominantly ionized (i.e., with small neutral gas fractions) and has a temperature < $10^5$ K
 star-forming
Many of the 21 cm HVCs at much larger distances from the disk are also detected in H ̨ emission indicating that the neutral gas clouds are surrounded by envelopes of ionized gas, whose masses are comparable with or even larger than the neutral gas body
the Milky Way’s accretion of warm ionized gas might be strongly influenced by the local galaxy environment and cosmological structure formation in the Local Group (N14)
#### Hot Ionized Gas
X-ray emission and absorption by OVII OVIII
20 kpc vs 260 kpc(virial radius) - gravitational bounded?
indirect evidence -  UV absorption-line detections of high-velocity OVI
#### Gas-Accretion Rates from Observations
MS dominate

## Simulations of Milky Way Gas Accretion
### Hydrodynamical Simulations of Gas Infall
#### ORIGIN:
   halo: Mhalo ~ $10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and Rvir ~ 250 kpc, T ~ $10^6$ K
the **cooling** and **fragmentation** of hot halo gas that falls towards the Galactic disk in the form of overdense clouds
    problem: buoyancy disrupt condensing seed structures before they can cool efficiently
	 -> non-linear perturbation / satellite accretion
	ratio between the cooling time and the acceleration time (to reach the sound speed)
**cloud-condensation scheme** and the **cold streams**, the **interaction of Milky Way-type galaxies with dwarf satellites**

inner: HVC <- condensation
outer: satellite
#### how much of it makes it into the disk? 
characteristic morphologies: head-tail structures, infall veloc- ities, disruption path lengths, and timescales.

problem:  
    Not all of the possibly relevant processes can be included simultaneously in the simulations - thermal conduction, magnetic fields ...

In summary, hydrodynamical simulations predict that the **life-time**, the **morphology**, and the **mass distribution** of infalling gas clouds in the Milky Way halo depend strongly on the **local boundary conditions** under which the gas is generated and moving through the hot halo
 
Whether or not an infalling cool/warm gas **cloud reaches** the Milky Way disk in a region where it supplements star formation depends on its **initial distance** to the disk, its **mass and density**, its **infall velocity**, its **angular momentum**, and other parameters.
