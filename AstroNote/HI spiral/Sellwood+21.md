## 6 Gas in spiral galaxies
### 6.1  Maintaining Spiral Activity
random motion -> collition -> radiation =>  which drives them toward non-intersecting streamlines that are circular in an axisymmetric potential
  
  Problem:  simulations are **unable** to model gas properly  because the dynamical processes of spiral formation occur on **spatial scales** too huge  to capture the full physical behavior of the clumpy, multiphase ISM -> more or less any rule that mimics dissipation prolongs spiral activity ->  Cosmological simulations of galaxy formation also mimic gas physics and support mild spiral patterns
 
gas clouds not only **dissipate random energy**, but new stars are formed with the kinematics of this lower velocity dispersion component -> low velocity star is  augmented ->  consume the gas &  locked away in low mass stars having essentially infinite lifetimes

  infalling gas fuel the galaxy -> replenishes the gas + raises the disk surface density -> smaller Q, makes the disk more responsive

a few solar masses per Earth year - sufficient cooling to balance the heating -> maintain star formation rates <- consistent with the observation

S0 galaxies: 1. for those in clusters, the reason might be the ISM stripped and deprived of fresh infalling gas; 2. there are still at least 2 difference between the S0 galaxies in clusters and fields: larger bulge and earlier time to stop the growth of the disk(less expanded disk) for cluster's.

  S0 galaxies also exist in the field, two mechanisms for their origin: faded spirals for low mass S0s, and mergers to create those of higher mass.

### 6.2 Gas Flows in Spiral Potentials
theoretical prediction: gas flows inwards in the arms, whereas outward flow along the arm is expected outside corotation

   Kim & Ostriker (2020) adopt an intermediate course, and try to build a more detailed picture of ISM behavior in a small part of the disk of a spiral galaxy that is subject to an imposed spiral perturbation ->  ==stars are preferentially formed in spiral arms== <-  converging gas flow

supernova feedback ->  spurs and feathers.

### 6.3 Flocculent Spirals
NGC 2841 & NGC5055 figure - 2 features in different bands
flocculent patterns arise through ==gravitational instabilities in a low-mass cool disk component== ->  the cool disk, also composed of collisionless particles, has one-tenth the mass (fd = 0.05) and an initial Q = 0.05, a deliberately low value to mimic the dynamical responsiveness of a gas-rich component

## ROLE OF SPIRALS IN GALAXY EVOLUTION
### 7.1 Radial Migration
attention focused on Lindblad resonance scattering by spirals, and changes at corotation went unreported.

The distribution of changes manifests an ==inclined ridge== in the middle of the range of Lz indicating ∆Lz values for some particles range up to ∼ Lz/2 at the start of this interval. The ==vertical lines== mark the estimated Lz values for corotation of three separate spiral modes in the disk in their simulation over a longer interval, 6 to 7 Gyr, but the middle wave dominates over time interval reported in Figure 7 (see their Fig. 6). 

  particles having smaller Lz values than the yellow line increased their initial Lz to rise outwards across corotation
  and others initially having larger Lz values lost similar amounts also to sink inside corotation. 
  
The numbers of gainers and losers were similar, and the slope of the ridge indicates that there was a tendency for particles that crossed CR to end up equally far in Lz from the resonance as before.

migration is rapid and occurs with no significant increase in the size of the orbit’s epicycle, indicated by the short period oscillations

These Lz changes, which completely dwarf those at the Lindblad resonances, had not attracted attention because they **do not heat the disk**

radial mixing of stars with different chemical abundances has important consequences for modeling the radial distribution of elements in a galaxy disk

#### 7.1.1 mechanism of radial migration
gravitational attraction to the particle inside and outside of the CR
   the particle are trapped, when reach the next density maximum where the changes would be exactly undone
   but the spiral was strong for less than half the horseshoe period for most star

####  7.1.2. Random Walk in Radius.
#### 7.1.3 in sub-maximum disk
reduce the extent of churning in both thick and thin disk

#### 7.1.4 observational evidence
not direct, GALAH in MW
three stand out:  
    Kordopatis et al. (2015): using RAVE data (Steinmetz et al. 2006), found 
      supersolar metallicity stars having lowish eccentricity orbits in the solar neighborhood and argued they must have migrated from the inner disk.
	Haydan:  found a striking systematic change with radius to the shape of 
       the midplane MDF and concluded that radial migration was the most likely explanation for the shape of the MDF in the outer Galaxy
    Frankel:  fitted a model of churning and blurring to APOGEE red clump 
       stars, concluding that the secular orbit evolution of the disk is dominated by diffusion in angular momentum, with radial heating being an order of magnitude lower.

###  7.2. Flattening Rotation Curves
The rotation curve, or circular speed as a function of radius, is remarkably smooth for most galaxies 
no matter what the angular momentum of the added particles, the mass distribution in the disk rearranged itself such that the resulting rotation curve became remarkably featureless.

#### 7.2.1 mechanism 
controlled experiment in which they added particles to the stable Mestel disk to build a narrow ridge ->  two unstable modes develop the spiral

Since CR scattering removed far more particles from the ridge than were added to it, the ridge was erased and the rotation curve was flattened almost perfectly.

### 7.3 Driving Turbulence in the ISM
 However, transient spiral waves churn not only the stellar distribution, but also the ISM.
 turbulence -> magnetic field; but even SN is too weak
 =>  particles from widely differing radii encounter each other, and that the spiral instability drives turbulence on a much greater radial scale than would supernovae
 =>  the slow magnetic field amplification from supernovae alone could be accelerated by this source of turbulence on grander scales.

 ### 7.4 Age-velocity dispersion relations
 different velocity population for stars in different age(metallicity)
